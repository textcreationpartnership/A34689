            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>And as not of the Author, ſo neither to the Work it ſelfe, ſhall I ſay ought this way. I judge it ſufficient to render it deſirable, to tell you it was the Work of that learned man; yet more, of that gracious man, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Servant of Chriſt, Mr. <hi>John Cotton,</hi> as is aſſured me by a reverend and godly neighbor, Mr. <hi>Tho. Oresby</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>Hackwell</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who well knew him, and heard him preach much of it: Such was the Author, that it commends the Work to atteſt it his; and yet ſuch is the Work it ſelfe, that though the Author were unknown, it could not however but meet with reverent and ready en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment for its own ſake. Had his own hand put it forth, doubtleſſe it had been more poliſht then now it is, more inlarged and refined: But Chriſtians know how to be charitable, &amp; to deale with the Works of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, brought into the world after themſelves were taken out of the world, as we doe by little Orphans whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is dead, if we ſee them any wayes miſuſed, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to any wants, we reproach them not, but pity them, becauſe their Carers for, are taken from them: And yet for the Work as it is, let me be bold to ſay, It may ſtand amongſt none of the meaneſt helps to ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>It's true, we live in a curious and carping age, an age wherein much knowledge, but (ſhame and griefe to ſpeake it) little obedience. Oh <hi>England!</hi> great are thy helps, thy means high, as to grace, and the things of thy

            <p>Take heed yet a little while, and you ſhall hear a voyce, <hi>Give an account of your ſtewardſhip;</hi> all talents and prizes of this nature muſt be one day accounted for, with which no people ſtored like thy ſelfe.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Children of God, as in the whole courſe of their lives they are exerciſed with many conflicts of Conſcience, ſo with this Doubt eſpecially, at their beginning to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a courſe of Chriſtianity, Whether they indeed doe belong to the election of Grace, and are indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the number of thoſe that belong unto God.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe Faith is very weak then in them for the moſt part, it cometh to paſſe, that their doubtings are ſtrong, they doubt much of this their Eſtate: And from doubtings, ariſeth trouble of mind, and terror of conſcience. When the Sun is in its full ſtrength, and ſhineth brightly, there are no Clouds, or Vapors, or Miſts ariſe, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it is low, at riſing or ſetting: ſo is it with Faith and Doubting; for the removall of which, and for the ſetling of our ſouls, in the aſſurance of Gods love, and for the pacifying of our conſciences with the Peace of God, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our hearts with joy in the Holy Ghoſt, St. <hi>John</hi> moved by the Holy Ghoſt penned this Epiſtle, as Chap. 1. v. 4.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe our joy cannot be full, except we injoy union with him, and communion with his Children; Therefore that end alſo he openeth, verſe 3. And becauſe theſe are both begun and preſerved by, Firſt, Receiving of the truth of Doctrine; Secondly, Walking in holineſſe of life.</p>
                  <p>And Contrariwiſe hindered and interrupted, Firſt, By Error in Doctrine;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65998:6"/>
Secondly, Wickedneſſe and uncleanneſſe of life; Therefore he every where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerteth inſtructions, both for, Firſt, Inlightning our minds with truth of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; Secondly, directing our ſteps with precepts of holineſſe of life.</p>
                  <p>And from both he teacheth us to gather marks to our ſelves of our Eſtate with God, that ſo our joy may be full.</p>
                  <p>In the Text he inſtructeth us in the knowledge of the Truth of this point of Doctrine, what we are to think and believe, concerning the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, whether preached or written. Concerning which Doctrine, two things are here delivered.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Subject of it, Chriſt Jeſus; Firſt, In himſelf, and that firſt as God, as from the beginning eternall, ſecondly, as man, as being heard, ſeen, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Secondly, As in himſelfe to us, the word of life, verſe 1.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The end and ſcope of it; Firſt, Subordinate, Fellowſhip with the Apoſtles, and Saints, and with God, verſe 3. Secondly, Supream, our fullneſſe of joy, verſe 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That which was from the beginning.]</hi> Here are two queſtions,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Why rather is it ſaid here, that was from the beginng, then he which was from the beginning?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What is it here to be from the beginning?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is here ſaid, that which was from the beginning, to ſignifie and ſet forth unto us, a double nature in one and the ſame word of life, in one and the ſame perſon of Chriſt; If he had ſaid, he who was from the beginning, whom we have ſeen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It might have been thought that the ſame word of life was in one and the ſame nature, both from the beginning, and ſeen, and heard, or elſe that one perſon was from the beginning, another perſon ſeen, and heard, but when he ſaith, that word of life, which was from the beginning, and that which we have heard, and ſeen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he plainly inſinuateth, that there is (as they ſay) <hi>aliud &amp; aliud,</hi> in the word of life.</p>
                  <p>There was ſomething of the word of life, that was from the beginning, as namely his Godhead; And againe, ſomething in the ſame word of life that was heard, and ſeen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as his Manhood, and withall, that this was not another perſon, but another thing, another nature in the ſame perſon. This ſerves to confute thoſe two Antient Hereſies of <hi>Eutiches</hi> and <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> he confounding the Natures this dividing the perſons of Chriſt. <hi>Euti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> confuted, becauſe ſomething there is of the word of life that was from the beginning, ſomething of the ſame word of life that was heard, and ſeen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that which was from the beginning, was not the ſame thing which was heard, and ſeen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that which was heard, and ſeen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not the ſame thing which was from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neſtorius</hi> is confuted, becauſe both that which was of the word from the beginning, and that of the word which was ſeen, and heard, were both of the ſame word of life, both the natures of one and the ſame perſon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Againe, if ſomething there be of the ſame word Eternall, and again ſomething of ſame the word Senſible, then there is no confuſion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties in the perſon of Chriſt. The Apoſtles preach ſuch a Chriſt, as of whom ſomething is from the beginning, ſomething againe heard, and ſeen, that of the word which was from the beginning, that of the word was not ſenſible, and that of the word which was ſenſible, was not that of the word which was Eternall.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ſuch as teach the fleſh of Chriſt to be every where (as the <hi>Germans</hi> doe) or every where in the Sacraments (as the Papiſts doe) they doe not obſerve the diſtinction here obſerved by the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>This Phraſe of ſpeech <hi>(from the beginning)</hi> is ambiguous, and muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted according to the nature of the thing to which it is attributed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Sometimes it ſignifieth from the beginning of the ſtory of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The time of the delivery of the Law, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65998:6"/>Thirdly, Inſtitution of a thing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.8.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Of the Fall, <hi>John</hi> 8.44.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Of the Creation, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.2.</p>
                  <p>But none of theſe meant here: not the Firſt, nor Second; for before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was, he was, <hi>John</hi> 8.58. not the Third, Fourth, nor Fifth; for he himſelfe created all things, <hi>John</hi> 1.3.</p>
                  <p>There is another from the beginning, which is higher than all theſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the beginning of eternity, which wanting beginning, implyeth he was before all beginnings, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.23.</p>
                  <div type="doctrine">
                     <head>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> And becauſe there cannot be two Eternals, but one Eternall, and that is God; therefore he alſo is Eternall, God with the Father, and Holy Ghoſt.</head>
                     <p>This is not to be omitted, becauſe it is plain, but to be preached, becauſe it is certaine; eſpecially ſince ſome of late have been ſo far bewitched by Satan, as to ſeal the contrary with their blood.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This is proved, firſt, by the Names and Titles given to him. 1. <hi>Very God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. 2. <hi>Jehovah, Exodus</hi> 3.2, 4, 6. 3. <hi>Saviour, Mat.</hi> 1.21. which none is but God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.11. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.4. And who was able to ſave us from ſin by ſatisfying Gods wrath, but God?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By the Eſſentiall Properties of the God-head agreeing to him. 1. Knowing the heart and reines, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.23. yea all things, <hi>John</hi> 21.17. 2. Omnipotency, <hi>John</hi> 5.19. 3. Omnipreſence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. <hi>John</hi> 3.13. 4. Eternity, <hi>John</hi> 8.58. &amp; 17.5. 5. And here equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with his Father, without Sacrilege, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By his works of, Firſt, Power, 1 Creation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. and that for his glory. 2. Providence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. 3. Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <hi>John</hi> 14.11.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Grace, 1 Election, <hi>John</hi> 13.8. 2 Redemption, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Giving of the Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 4.10. <hi>John</hi> 7.39.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, By the Worſhip aſcribed to him, 1. Prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> 2. Faith in him, for elſe how could we call on him? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. Taketh no place in him, but contrary, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To confute all thoſe Blaſpemous hereſies, whereby Satan hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to overthrow the Truth of the God-head of Chriſt; as that of the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians, Ebonites, Arians,</hi> which taught him onely to be pure man, to have no being before the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or at moſt before the Creation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To Terrifie all ſuch as are Enemies to his Kingdome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.14, 27.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To Comfort all ſuch as are Chriſts, <hi>John</hi> 10.28. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 23.1. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.1, 2. becauſe they were elected in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. and our life is hid with him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. Therefore it is both ſure and unchangeable, for he is ſo.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, To exhort us to worſhip him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.9. as an Eternall God, God from the beginning; <hi>Moſes</hi> reproved the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for worſhipping new Gods, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.17. Gods whom their Fathers did not know, but him they knew and worſhiped; <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.16. <hi>Jacob, Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.15, 16. <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22.11, 12.</p>
                     <p>Now his Worſhip conſiſteth in the duties of Faith and Repentance, for thoſe are the parts of Gods Worſhip which he hath revealed to us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In the Duties of Faith, <hi>John</hi> 14.1. and here</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Doſt thou receive any thing from God? receive it in the ſight of thine own unworthineſſe in thy ſelfe, and ſo thou worſhipeſt him, through whom God doth accept thee, and powreth his bleſſings upon thee, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. for none but God could receive them for us from all eternity.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Doſt thou give any thing to God? offer up any obedience? do
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65998:7"/>
it in the ſight of thine own weakneſſe and imperfection, and ſo thou wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipeſt him, through whom our lame ſacrifices are acceptable, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. for none but God could doe this for us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Doſt thou want any thing? ſeek unto God in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and believe thou ſhalt receive it, and ſo thou doſt honour him, <hi>John</hi> 16.23, 24. for none but God can procure this for us.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Doth Satan at any time tempt thee to doubt of thy reconciliation with God? believe that Chriſt Jeſus is God, and therefore hath made full ſatisfaction and propitiation for thy ſins, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2. for God can fully do this for us.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Doſt thou doubt of the truth of any of the promiſes of God, through unbeliefe? believe they are Yea and Amen in him, and ſo thou wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipeſt him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. for God can call things that are not, as though they were.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In Dutyes of Repentance, as</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Doſt thou at any time (as thou oughteſt continually) remember thine old ſin? O! remember withall, him whom thou crucifiedſt by them was the Eternall God, the Lord of glory, and that will work a godly ſorrow, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. to ſee him to abaſe himſelfe for my ſake.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Doth Satan tempt thee at any time to commit any ſin? O! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thereby thou ſhouldeſt trample under foot the blood of the Son of God, who hath ſaved thee from thy ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.</p>
                     <p>1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>That which we have heard,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>As ſomething of the word of life, was eternall from the beginning, ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ſenſible, which was 1 Heard, 2 Seen and looked upon, 3 Handled.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, For the meaning of this, what is that of the word which firſt he ſaith, we have heard?</p>
                     <p>They heard of him not a word of rumor, but 1. His Doctrine, <hi>John</hi> 6.68. 2. The Teſtimony which his Father gave of him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5, 6. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17.</p>

                        <hi>Now for the Reaſons why Chriſt became man, they are</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, That he might be a middle perſon, or of a middle nature, between the perſons offending, and the perſons offended; if he had ſtill remained God, he had been the perſon offended with us; or if onely man, then he had been the party offending: and therefore that he might be of a middle condition, it was needfull he ſhould take upon him our nature.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That that nature of ours which had offended, might make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; if he had not taken on him our nature, he could not have ſatisfied for our ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That he might be able to ſuffer death for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. which God could not doe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That he might be the better compaſſionate of our infirmities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65998:8"/>The Reaſons why Chriſt became not an Angel, which the Schoolmen render, are divers, principally theſe;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Angels being created all at once, and not propagated one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by generation, though many of them fell, yet God loſt not the whole kind, becauſe many of them ſtood: but men proceeding all from one ſtock or root, he being corrupt, all his Off-ſpring were in the ſame Eſtate; ſo that if God had not provided this means of Chriſts incarnation for him, he had loſt the Creature wholly.</p>
                     <p>But to this I anſwer, God might have made many men once, as well as Angels, and ſo might have provided another means of ſaving ſome of them, as he did the Angels, but that he would ſet forth the abundant riches of his love to man, in ſaving them, by giving of his own Son.</p>
                     <p>Again, though all men had periſhed, they had had but their deſert, and God might have had more ſervice, by one Angell redeemed, than by many millions of men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Angels fell of themſelves, but man by their procurement.</p>
                     <p>To this alſo I ſay, That the greater the Angels ſin was, the greater is their miſery, and the greater their miſery is, the greater mercy had God ſhewed to have redeemed them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Angels conceiving things, not by diſcourſe, but by a preſent view of all things that any way pertain to thoſe things they turn themſelves unto, they doe all things with ſo full reſolution, that they cannot alter their mind, or repent; but man conceiving things by diſcourſe, findeth them in the event many times to prove otherwiſe than he expected, and ſo may come to alter his mind, and be fit to be brought to repentance.</p>
                     <p>To this take this anſwer, That the Angels being of a finite nature, muſt needs conceive one thing after and upon another, which is diſcourſe, and ſo ſubject to error, and ſo of themſelves capable of repentance; was not the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill deceived in <hi>Job? Job</hi> 1.11.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Angels being pure, immateriall, intellectuall Spirits, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the preſence of God, and in the light of his countenance, could not ſin by error or miſ-perſwaſion, but of purpoſed malice, which is the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, irremiſſible; but man fell by error and miſ-perſwaſion.</p>
                     <p>For anſwer hereunto, take this, That though the Devills dwelt in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God (which cannot be proved) yet they received no more light than God would communicate to them, and who can ſay that God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ſo much to them, but that upon wilfull not attendance to him, they might be deceived?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, As men have a time, after which there is no place left for helping or altering their Eſtate, ſo was it meet Angels ſhould have the like; that time to men is bodily death, which becauſe Angels are not ſubject to, it was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet their time ſhould be their firſt ſpirituall death, their firſt ſins, hence <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hoc eſt Angelis caſus, quod hominibus mors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I ſay, That the Angels might have had another time, beyond which there hath been no place for repentance, namely not their firſt ſin, but their wilfull rejecting of a Saviour, if he had pleaſed to have offered them any. Thus you ſee that all theſe (and ſo are the reſt) but mens devices and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; the true reaſon you have, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. Gods love to us, which alſo cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Lord to ſay, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.4. God neither turneth nor returneth, Angels turn, but return not, men both turn and return, through this unſpeakable love of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To confute the Hereſies of <hi>Eutiches</hi> and the <hi>Maniches,</hi> who taught Chriſt had no true, but a phantaſticall body.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To ſtir us up to ſome duties, 1 of Meditation, 2 of Practice.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Of Meditation, and that 1 Concerning God, and 1 Concerning his Juſtice, ſo ſevere againſt ſin, as all the meer men in the world could not ſatisfie for it, and therefore Chriſt became man, and that is the reaſon why
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65998:8"/>
the damned are tormented, becauſe they cannot ſatisfie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, His mercy and and love to us; the Father to abaſe his Son, the Son to abaſe himſelfe for us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, His Wiſdome, to find out ſuch a means to ſave us, when he paſſed by the more glorious Angels.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Concerning our ſelves, who were in ſo wretched a condition, as the blood of Bulls and Goats could not ſave us, men and Angells could not help us, onely the Son of God muſt empty himſelfe of Glory and Majeſty, and become man for us: if therefore thou haſt not part in Chriſt Jeſus, the ſame ſins which plucked Chriſt from Heaven to Earth, will pluck thee from the Earth to Hell.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It may ſtir us up to ſome duties of practice. 1. To teach us Humility, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By Conſidering our own Eſtates, and the miſery thereof, which cauſed him to take upon him the form of a ſervant.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By Conſidering his example, who took upon him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to be ſerviceable to us; ſo ought we to abaſe our ſelves to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our Brethren.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To ſtir us up to labor to be united to his nature, as he was to ours, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. he became the ſon of man, that we might become the ſons of God; we cannot anſwer the intent of his incarnation better.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To move us to an holy thankfulneſſe and joyfullneſſe in the Lord, as
<list>
                           <item>1. <hi>Zachary</hi> bleſſed the Lord in this behalfe, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.68.</item>

                           <item>4. <hi>Abraham</hi> long before, <hi>John</hi> 8.56. he ſaw it in the promiſe, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.16, 17. and hereupon called his Son <hi>Iſaac.</hi>

                     <p>And ſure if <hi>John</hi> wrote every Doctrine in this Epiſtle, that our joy might be full, as chap. 1.4. then hence alſo let us raiſe up our hearts to this holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this is the fitteſt exerciſe for Chriſtmas, otherwiſe uſually ſpent in carnall delights, becauſe men have no part in this joy.</p>

                        <hi>Doct.</hi> If the Apoſtles ſaw and heard theſe things of the word of life, then bleſſed were they, <hi>Luke 10.22, 23.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>Why? Becauſe of his comely beauty, and goodly proportion? no, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2. and then <hi>Judas</hi> had been an happy man, as happy as the reſt of the Apoſtles. But the Reaſons are theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By this means they had a greater meaſure of knowledge, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.22, 23. he expounded to them the ſecrets of the Kingdome of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11, 16. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.34. hence is that of the Samaritan woman, <hi>John</hi> 4.34. hence it was that <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt was more excellent than others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.11. So that as <hi>Solomons</hi> ſervants were happy, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.8. ſo much more Chriſts Diſciples, who ſaw and heard a greater than <hi>Solomon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Their Faith alſo by this means was more ſtrengthned in the truth of this great promiſe of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which had been deferred ſo long, <hi>John</hi> 20.29. It is many times an exerciſe to Faith, to be commanded, to believe what we ſee not, but to ſee what we belive not, is a great ſtrengthning to a weak Faith. Again, a greater meaſure of knowledge, is a notable means of a greater meaſure of Faith. And if you object againſt this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.2.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, That the meaning of the place is this, that though things be not ſeen, yet Faith maketh them evident; not that whatſoever we believe by Faith is not ſeen, <hi>Stephan</hi> ſaw and believed the ſame, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.55. There is a threefold light, of Senſe, of Reaſon, of Faith, when a thing is obſcure to both the former, Faith will make it evident.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Their Peace of Conſcience alſo, hereby was more ſetled and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.29, 30. for he ſaw now Chriſt was come to accompliſh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65998:9"/>
that work of reconciliation, which before was promiſed, and to make up our Peace with God; In theſe regards the glory of the ſecond Temple was greater than that of the former, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.10. the ſecond Temple wanted five things of the former, <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, the Pot of <hi>Manna, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> fire from Heaven, and yet it was greater than the former, becauſe theſe three, Knowledge, Faith, and Peace of Conſcience, were ſo much increaſed, not to a few, as it was before, but generally, even to the ſimple.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>But Chriſt is called the word of God in four reſpects, as he is the wiſdome, image, interpreter, and promiſe of the Father.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The wiſedome of the Father; as reaſon floweth from the ſoul, or minde of man, and is not any accident to it, but of the ſame nature with it, (though there is an accidentall wiſdome in us, which is habituall, yet there is alſo an eſſentiall wiſdome in us, namely, our Reaſon which is naturall) ſo Chriſt (who is the reaſon and wiſdome of the Father) flowed from the Father, was begotten of him, and is of the ſame nature with him, hence he is called the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that dwelleth with God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1, 22, 24, 25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. and the Holy Ghoſt may ſeem to have reference to this place, <hi>John</hi> 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the deſcription which he maketh of the world, it ſeemeth he took from that deſcription of wiſdome, if you compare theſe places. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.1. with <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.3. with <hi>John</hi> 1.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. to 30. with <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.34. with <hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.35. with <hi>John</hi> 1.5. and chap. 1.22, 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, As the words or ſpeech of the man, is a character of his minde, for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh, a rotten heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth and ſtreameth forth unſavoury ſpeeches, an holy heart breatheth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65998:9"/>
out gracious words, ſo is Chriſt the character, or engraven forme of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As the ſpeech or word of a man doth declare the will and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and Counſell of the ſpeaker, ſo doth Chriſt of the Father, <hi>John</hi> 1.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Chriſt may very well be called the word of God, or the ſpeech of God, becauſe he it was of whom the Lord ſpake from the beginning, that is, the word of promiſe which he made to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. hence Chriſt is called the Promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. hence he who is called a Servant, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.19. is called the word, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.21. that is, a ſervant ſpoken of or promiſed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Chriſt is called a word of life.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe he hath eſpeciall life in himſelfe, <hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>John</hi> 5.6.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 He communicates ſpirituall life, and that he doth, 1. By dying for us, for his death is our life; as by his wounds we are healed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. ſo by his life we live, now the life we live by Chriſts death, is</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Juſtification, that is forgiveneſſe of ſins, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. therefore he is called the juſtification of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. we without his death were dead, meer Children of death, as condemned perſons, and Chriſts death procuring us pardon, procured us life.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Mortification; it is the firſt part of ſpirituall life (inherent in us) to die to ſin; and that was procured by Chriſts death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He communicates ſpirituall life to us, by riſing for us, for as we have been like him in dying to ſin by his death, ſo doe we live to God by his life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5, 10, 11. now the life we live by his Reſurrection, is</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Vivification, or newneſſe of life, Chriſt now living in us by his Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. Hence as living trees of Righteouſneſſe we bring forth fruit unto God, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. 2 Reſurrection to glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. hence he is called a quickning Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If Chriſt be a word of life, then men out of Chriſt have no life in them, they have neither the life of juſtification, nor mortification, nor vivifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor reſurrection to glory, but are ſtark dead men to grace and glory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If Chriſt be a word of life, then we who profeſſe our ſelves to be Chriſtians, to be Members of Chriſt, are to live no life but this; now for the better conceiving of this, know that we live a threefold life, 1. Naturall, 2. Spirituall, 3. Carnall; whereby we live the life, 1 Of Reaſon, 2 Grace 3 Sin.</p>
                     <p>The two former we may live, and are ſo to doe, becauſe we receive both theſe lives from Chriſt the word of life; the laſt we are not to live, for the Members can live no life but the life of their head, the branches live no life but the life of the root; Hence <hi>Paul</hi> lived not, but Chriſt in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Now that we may doe this, we muſt eſteem and carry our ſelves as dead men to all things elſe; that we may wholly live, and move, and have our being to him: and from hence ariſe three duties.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, We are no longer to live unto friends, to riches, honours, or pleaſures, but to the Lord; we once were wedded to ſuch things, but now being dead, we are free from them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.1, 2. if theſe call for any motion

                     <p>For the meaning of this, to bear witneſſe unto Chriſt, and to declare him to the Church, is all one, they bare witneſſe unto him by declaring of him, they declared him by bearing witneſſe unto him.</p>
                     <p>Hence it was, that when he appointed them to be declarers, and publiſhers of his Goſpel to all the World, he appointed them onely to bear witneſſe to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.8. ſo alſo is witneſſing put for declaring, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21.</p>
                     <p>For the confirmation of this Propoſition, not to heap many places in a clear truth, take theſe two, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.30, 40, 41. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.32.</p>
                     <p>But how could the Apoſtles bear witneſſe to Chriſt, ſeeing he receiveth not the teſtimony of men? <hi>John</hi> 5.33, 34.</p>

                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The Apoſtles taught nothing but what was manifeſt to their ſenſes. See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. Compare with him his Succeſſor, who ſeeing great ſums of Money brought in by Indulgences, Pardons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaid to one of his Cardinalls, <hi>O quantum fabula iſta de Chriſto nobis proficit!</hi> Again, ſenſe took away doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even from unbelieving <hi>Thomas,</hi> John 20.25, 27, 28.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle again and again ingeminates here, that what they taught was manifeſt to their ſenſe; now ingeminations are for confirmations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.32. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.6. this therefore doth ſhew again, how confident he was of it himſelfe, <hi>i. e.</hi> therefore no marvell of that ſpeech, <hi>John</hi> 21. <hi>penult.</hi> We know, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4. And for a fourth Reaſon, conſider another Branch of the power of this Doctrine, the Apoſtles that declared it were for the moſt part poor and ſimple men, and unlearned men, the Doctrine taught was but of a Crucified Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, harſh to carnall ears, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. the times were ſuch, wherein it was not onely every where ſpoken againſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.22. but alſo grievouſly perſecuted throughout the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and that with exquiſite Torments, and yet it did ſo powerfully work,<note place="margin">Plut in Apop. Priſ. Regum.</note> that in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time (which was the next Age after Chriſt) there were more Chriſtians every where, than of all other Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beſides. <hi>Cyrus</hi> indeed allured many to be his followers; but he ſent out great men to make another kinde of Proclamation, Whoſoever will come and follow after me, if he be a Foot-man, I will make him a Horſ-man; if he be a Horſ-man, I will make him a Rider in a Coach; if a Farmer, a Gentleman; if he poſeſſe a Cottage, I will give him a Village; if he have a Village, I will give him a City; and if he be Lord of a City, I will make him Prince of a Region, or Country; and as for Gold, I will pour it out to him by weight and heaps, and not by number: But Chriſts Proclamation is contrary, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23. &amp; 14.26. and yet had he infinitely more fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
                  <p>All other Reaſons, as the teſtimony of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but like the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> preparing us to believe, <hi>John</hi> 4.29. this convinceth us ſo ſtrongly, that in compariſon we reject other Reaſons moving us to believe, as they did, <hi>John</hi> 4.41, 42.

Faith, which is but a bare credulity, is in a degree of perfection inferior to ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo that Faith which is wrought in us by the work of the Holy Ghoſt is greater, and more certain, than any ſcience, gotten by demonſtration.</p>

                  <p>And ſo in this we ſhall follow the Apoſtles, and this we may do by two means eſpecially.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By preaching nothing but what we have good warrant for from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; for the Scriptures are of certain Truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.27.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By having our hearts eſtabliſhed with Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. two laſt verſes, where he ſaith, No Scripture is of any private motion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, becauſe being penned at firſt by the Spirit, by him beſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; hence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 laſt. If theſe means were ſufficient, how comes it to paſſe that the Children of God having theſe means, have yet differed one from another by not attending to theſe means? but leaning to their own judgment, or the opinions of men, are carried with ſome ſiniſter reſpect of their own credit and eſtimation in the world; ſee <hi>Luthers</hi> example of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſubſtantiation, and therein diſſenting from others of his Brethren.</p>
                  <p>The end of the Apoſtles writings followeth, which are</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Subordinate, Fellowſhip with the Apoſtles and Diſciples. 2 Union with God, verſe 3. 2 Supream, Fullneſſe of joy, verſe 4.</p>
                  <p>Before we come to ſpeak of theſe ſeverally, ſome things more may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all theſe joyntly, touching the nature of the Scriptures, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For the perfection of the Scripture; for if the Apoſtles declared what they had heard and ſeen, to the end that we might have fellowſhip with God and them, and fulneſſe of joy, then either they failed of their end, or elſe wee by their Doctrine (written for that purpoſe, verſe 4) may have all things neceſſary for ſalvation, yea what is ſalvation it ſelfe, but theſe very ends? Our Saviour calls it (which was a good concluſion of the whole Bible, for the Goſpel was written laſt of all, to ſtop the mouths of <hi>Ebion, Corinthus, &amp;c.</hi> who then began to urge the traditions of the Apoſtles in time of his baniſhment, ſee <hi>Euſebius</hi>) eternal life, to know him, and what more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table knowledge of him than this? <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. hence alſo <hi>John</hi> 20. 2 laſt. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2 laſt; away then with Popiſh traditions which the Papiſts alledge, they are either falſe Doctrines, as invocations of Saints images, tranſubſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. or certainly true, as Baptiſme of infants, truth of Scripture, &amp;c. and theſe may be proved by Scripture; or ſuch as ſeem not neceſſarily to procure us Felloſhip with the Saints, as the perpetuall Virginity of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whether the Hebrew womens children had any Sacrament to initiate them into the Church, and yet the Papiſts elſe where prove all theſe by Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65998:14"/>2 The profit of the Scripture; that Doctrin by which we come to have ſuch comfortable and excellent benefits (ſuch as than which none are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) muſt needs be of ſingular profit and commodity, yea no profit like to this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. Hence <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10. and therefore we are never to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we have profited by their Doctrin, when we can ſpeak and diſcourſe of it, but when we have found it to have wrought theſe heavenly things in us, he that will be converſant in it, to practiſe it indeed, muſt labour for theſe things by it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 And again, if the Word be ſo profitable, they loſe not their labour, who ſeek it from Sea to Sea, and from Eaſt to Weſt, as <hi>Amos</hi> 8 12. if by ſeeking they find it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.32. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> it is no vain gadding humour this deſire to hear the Word.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The power of the Apoſtles Doctrin, of the Scripture; that which muſt bring us from having fellowſhip with Satan, and the unfruitful works of darkneſſe, to have fellowſhip with the Saints, yea God himſelf, and to enjoy fulneſſe of joy, what admirable efficacie muſt it needs be of? Hence <hi>Romans</hi> 1.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. this word muſt needs be ſtronger than Satan, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21, 22.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1 This reproveth the practiſe of thoſe who will profeſſe that the Word of God taketh place in them, and hath power upon them, yet they ſtill keep their old fellowſhip with Satan with the wicked of the World, with the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of darkneſſe. See <hi>John</hi> 5.38.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2 Then fellowſhip with God, and with the Saints, and fulneſſe of joy may be obtained, elſe why did the Apoſtles preach, and write of Chriſt to that end? It is a let by which Satan keepeth many from ſeeking theſe things, becauſe they think them impoſſible to be attained, as it was with the Jews, <hi>John</hi> 6, 52, 66. ſo it is common in this caſe with many, but <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> though at firſt he conceived not ſuch a like myſtery as this, yet at length having it explained, he came to Jeſus by night, and his Doctrin took place in him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.9. &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.50, 52. &amp; <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.39.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3 Then great reaſon have we all to attend to the Doctrin of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; art thou a man yoaked under the bondage of Satan, and canſt not free thy ſelf from his fellowſhip? attend to the Doctrin of the Apoſtles, it will give thee fellowſhip with God, and the Saints, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18.

                  <p>The communion of the Saints is a Spiritual conjunction of the Saints with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and one another, wherein Chriſt partaketh of our infirmities, and we in common partake of benefits, and communicate them one to another.</p>

                  <p>FOr the meaning of theſe word, we muſt ſhew you</p>
                  <p n="1">1 What is here meant by Joy: 2 How this joy is ſaid to be full.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Some by Joy underſtand that glorious Eſtate full of delight and pleaſure which the Saints in Heaven enjoy, and we our ſelves hope for after this life, according to that <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> but here I ſuppoſe (though that be not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but followeth upon the other) to be meant that joy in the Holy Ghoſt, which ſuch as have fellowſhip with Chriſt enjoy in this life,</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons why I think ſo are two.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Becauſe though in Heaven be fullneſſe of joy, yet in Scripture phraſe, Heaven (to my remembrance) is no where called full of joy, nay in St. <hi>Johns</hi> courſe of ſpeech there is another on this ſide Heaven which is called full joy, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 What St. <hi>John</hi> meaneth by this end of his writing, fullneſſe of joy, we may eaſily conjecture by the means he uſeth to procure it to us, now if you mark it, the whole courſe of his writing is in a manner nothing elſe but a laying down of certain marks, whereby we may examin our ſelves; and diſcern whether we have fellowſhip with God or no, whether we be in the Eſtate of Grace or no, See one, verſe 6, 7. another, 8, 9. another, Chap. 2. verſe 3. now theſe marks do not ſo directly tend to procure us fullneſſe of joy in Heaven, as to ſettle our hearts in the aſſurance of this point, that we are in the Eſtate of Grace, and ſo may reap and receive, true and ſound Peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and full joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>So that by full joy, I here underſtand joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>For the better and more profitable handling whereof there is to be ſhewn.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 What this Joy is. 2 How it is ſaid to be full. 3 Some Corolaries from thence. For the firſt, What this Joy is.</p>
                  <p>Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, is a ſpiritual affection ariſing from peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby we rejoyce in our union with Chriſt, with joy unſpeakable and glorious. Or joy in the Holy Ghoſt is a ſpiritual affection, whereby the heart is unſpeakably and gloriouſly enlarged and raviſhed upon the ſolid apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of union and communion with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It is a ſpiritual joy] not only becauſe the objects of it are ſpiritual good things, union with Chriſt, and the benefits which we reap from it. (Adoption, Righteouſneſſe, Holineſſe, protection of Angels, dominion over the Creatures, right to a glorious inheritance) but alſo and that more principally, becauſe it is wrought in us by the holy Spirit, hence it is called Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. hence he is called the Comforter <hi>John</hi> 15. <hi>penult.</hi> when God and Chriſt are ſaid to dwell in the hearts of faithfull men, nothing elſe is meant; but the Holy Ghoſt dwelling in them, and working this joy (<hi>John</hi> 14.23. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20.) <hi>John</hi> 14.18. compared with <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Ariſing from Peace of Conſcience] <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. now peace of conſcience is a work of the Holy Ghoſt, which ariſeth from feeling of our righteouſneſſe, or our juſtification before God, for to be juſtified before God, is not enough to pacifie the the conſcience, unleſſe it be felt. See <hi>Davids</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.8, 12. Hence ariſeth that diſtinction of four ſorts of conſciences,

                  <p>That the Doctrin of the Goſpel is a Meſſage appears,</p>

                  <p n="1">1 If the Goſpel, or the Apoſtles Doctrin be a Meſſage, then it hath not its Authority from ſuch as deliver it, for it is not the Meſſengers part to judge, or ratifie his Meſſage, but to bear witneſſe to it, to declare it.</p>

                  <p>Then Verſ. 5. he comes to a particular of that Subject which he had handled before in general, he tells them one thing that he had heard of Chriſt, and that was, that God is Light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all; this was, one part of the Meſſage he was to deliver.</p>

                  <p>Now we come to the application of it; he deſiring to train them up in the fulneſſe of joy, he deſires to clear all doubts; therefore this is his method, he tells you of ſome things he heard from Chriſt, and then he gives ſignes of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Chriſt, that ſo every one might know what part he hath in this joy.</p>
                  <p>From this he gathers a double note of our fellowſhip with God, whereby we may know it, that ſo our joy may be full, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6.

                        <hi>A.</hi> It is true, there are many means to purge us from ſin, but no efficacy in any of them, except by virtue of Chriſts Blood; therefore thoſe in Hell have no benefit, becauſe Chriſts bloud reacheth not thither, ſo that if any be bettered by Afflictions, or Word, or Sacraments, it is from the virtue of Chriſts bloud, and if Chriſts bloud be ſprinkled on Purgatory, we will not reject it.</p>

A Lamb defiled in the old Law was never accepted, though it were ſlain for a Sacrifice, and if it had been without ſpot and blemiſh, yet if it had not been ſlain it would not have been accepted neither; ſo had not Chriſt been a Lambe ſpotleſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, his death would not have cleanſed us from our ſins, and though he were ſpotleſſe and undefiled, yet he muſt be ſlain, or elſe we could not be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

neither, the purity of Chriſts Nature doth not cleanſe us from ſin; but we muſt take all joyntly together, all his active obedience was paſſive, and all his paſſive obedience was active, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. that he was obedient to the Law was part of his Paſſion, and by the obedience of Chriſt to the death, we are cleanſed from all ſin.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 It is a pernicious and dangerous errour, it roots out all grace.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is an errour, and deluſion, for it is contrary to Gods expreſſe Word, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. Who can ſay he is clean? <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.22. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.46. <hi>James</hi> 3.2. In many things we ſin all, both in matter and manner.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is a wilfull errour, a man doth not learn it from others, but he perſwades himſelfe ſo.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe if any read the Scriptures, he ſhall find it contrary, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, It is a dangerous Errour,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe it evacuates all truth of Grace, where this conceit is, there can be no truth of grace, becauſe all truth of grace expreſſeth it ſelfe in Three things;</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In ſomething about ſin, every godly man firſt renounceth all his own righteouſneſſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 He fights againſt ſin to the death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.4. Now if every godly man doe thus, how can any truth of grace be, where a man either thinks or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth he hath no ſin?</p>

                     <p>It reproves likewiſe the Libertines, that counted themſelves perfect keepers of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Such are the Papiſts, that ſay the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was without ſin, ſhe doth not ſay it her ſelfe, ſhe acknowledgeth a Saviour, and therefore had ſin.</p>
                     <p>And ſo all they are deceivers of themſelves, that ſo live as if they were free from ſin, that conceive well of themſelves in a carnall Eſtate; and ſuch is the body of the World, they will, it may be, ſay they are ſinners, but why then doe they not repent and mourn for ſin? why, they ſee no need of that, I have lived honeſtly all my life, and I hope my Eſtate is good, and ſo deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

But</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="1">1. It exceedingly humbles us, and makes us willing to accept any hand of God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.41, 42. how doe theſe men come to be humbled? if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſins, and the ſins of their Fathers, this will humble them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Confeſſion of ſin to God, doth reſtrain us from Commiſſion of ſin, for a man conſiders he muſt come before God, and break his heart for it, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous heart is more aſhamed of his ſin before God, than before men, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51. <hi>Againſt thee, againſt thee onely have I ſinned,</hi> that moſt affected him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Confeſſion of Sin makes us examine our ſelves, and that is very profitable when a man comes and conſiders the frame of his heart and life, it afflicts him much, as the ſearching of a Wound doth anguiſh the Body, ſo examination of our ſelves doth much afflict our ſouls.</p>
                     <p>Now for the properties of this Confeſſion, it muſt be ſerious and ſincere, and with a reſolution to doe ſo no more, when a man confeſſeth his ſins with griefe of heart that he hath offended God, and reſolves never to doe the like again, this is very effectuall.</p>

humble Sinner goes before Juſtification, and Sanctification; many a man comes to be humbled, and yet is confident his ſinne is neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given nor his heart ſanctified: if Confeſſion be the way to Pardon, what need a man confeſſe his Sins, if he be truly perſwaded they be forgiven? we grant therefore that Repentance is the way to Pardon, to the ſence of it at leaſt. It is a queſtion whether Repentance go before Faith, or Faith before Repentance. I anſwer, if you take it practically, there is no man that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believes his ſin pardonned, or healed, till he brought to Humiliation, contrition, and ſorrow.</p>

I would ask you, whether you have walked in a ſence of your ſinfulneſſe daily? If not, no wonder though your joy be over clouded and Eclipſed; Saint <hi>John</hi> would have us ſtrongly perſwaded of this, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we make God a Lyar,</hi> &amp;c. therefore if any Chriſtian can go all the day without any ſence or remorſe for ſin, his heart ſtartles him not, if it be thus, no wonder though his joy be eclipſed; On the contrary, if you go on continually in a ſenſible apprehenſion of your ſinfulneſſe, and ſo renew your Repentance, and Faith, and Mortification, this will make you ſtill to cleanſe your ſelves daily, and ſo you would keep your joy renewed daily. We never had cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of our eſtate, but it was by reaſon of hardneſſe of heart, and how come our hearts to be hardned, ſin gets within us, and we perceive it not, and ſo we are hardned by it, and then our joy is overclouded, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.13, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. therefore if we would keep our hearts from hardneſſe, let us labour to ſpy out our ſins, and be humbled for them daily, and ſo you will keep a ſoft heart, and a ſoft heart is commonly peaceable.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Of direction to Miniſters, or ſuch as intend the Miniſtery, what is it about which they are moſt to bend their endeavours? to be fruitfull, to beget Children to God: it is meet for a Miniſter to look at the good reſpect of the people, and living, and maintenance, but he is chiefly to deſire and bend his endeavours to beget Children to God, to beget ſuch to God whom he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as Children, with like care and diligence; for a man to look at prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or credit, or wealth, theſe are but husks of his imployment, the true end of his Calling is to beget Children.</p>
                     <p>How may that be done?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He is to look that he grow ſtrong himſelfe, for weak men in nature are not <hi>prolifici,</hi> therefore Miniſters muſt labour to grow ſtrong in grace, a man without grace ſeldome begets any to God, therefore they muſt firſt mortifie ſin, and then increaſe in grace, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.13.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There may be ſtrength in Miniſters, yet there may be a diſproportion betwixt them, and their people, therefore Miniſters and people muſt ſtrive to keep a proportion and correſpondence, he muſt ſee how he may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate himſelf to the temper of his people, they muſt with <hi>Paul,</hi> become all to all, that they may beget ſome: in any thing that is lawfull he muſt acom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate, but he muſt by no means comply to the evill humours of his people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19. for then he brings contempt upon his Life and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Look that your Seed be Spirituall, that is, the pure Word diſpenſed in the Spirit and Power, mingle no Traditions or Tricks of your wit with it, if you doe, your Seed is corrupt, and wants vigour, a velvet ſcabbard dulls the edge of the Sword, ſo the Word deckt over with Human eloquence is like a Sword in a velvet ſcabbard, it hinders the power of it, what hath the Chaffe to doe with the Wheat? <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.28, 29. you muſt not mingle the Word with the dreams and fancies of men, but diſpence the Word in the power and evidence of the Spirit, and labour to have the Word ſealed in your hearts, that you may ſpeak out of the heart and inward affection; that Word which comes from the heart, ſooner goes to the heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. It may teach Hearers how to hear the Word of God aright, if Miniſters are ſo to diſpenſe the Seed of the Word that they may beget Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to God, then Hearers muſt learn how to apply themſelves towards their Miniſters, not to content themſelves in having gotten good Miniſters, and their reſpect to them (though theſe be very good) till you be Children to him whom he hath begot if you were not ſo before, or if you were, yet Children to be nurſed by him; ſuck nouriſhment from him, grow in grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, labour to receive ſtronger meat from him, that you may become Fathers to others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. it yeelds much comfort to the ſpirit of a man, when he can ſay, the ſeed of ſuch and ſuch a Sermon converted him, it often fills a man with many doubts, becauſe he hath not diſcerned the power of the Word.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. It may teach both Miniſters and people ſo to carry themſelves one towards another, as Fathers and Children; as many times a Marriner carries a King over Sea, but though he be a Prince, yet in that caſe he muſt be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65998:29"/>
ruled by the Marriner; ſo a Miniſter may teach Princes and great men, and they in this caſe muſt be as Children to him.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. People are to give their Teachers ſuch kinde of reſpect as Children owe to Parents, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14, 15.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Children owe to Parents imitation in any good carriage, and the more they ſee the Image of God in them, the more they are to imitate them; ſo people are to follow their Miniſters in any good counſell or carriage, that is the duty of Children to their Spirituall Fathers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15, 16. it will lie upon the Conſciences of people to imitate any vertues they ſee in their Teachers, becauſe they are their Fathers, as Children doe imitate their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Obedience in the Lord is required of Hearers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.22. ſpeaking of <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Ye know the proof of him, how as a Son with the Father he ſerved with me in the Gospel,</hi> he makes it his commendation, he never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded any duty to him, but he readily obeyed him as a Childe his Father, he ſhewed profeſſed obedience to the Goſpel of Chriſt; ſo people are to yeeld obedience to the Goſpell of Chriſt, which they receive from their Miniſters.</p>
                     <p>Now on the other ſide, it alſo teacheth Miniſters wherein to ſhew their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood to their people, not onely in begetting Children, for that is the leaſt part of Paternity, but they are not then to leave them, for ſtill there are ſome Corruptions cleaving to Children from the Wombe, which if they be not hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped againſt, they will periſh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.4. ſo Miniſters will be but Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, if when they have begotten Children by the Seed of the Word, they leave them to their rawneſſe, and corruptions of their own hearts, and doe not help them againſt them, and help them to grow in grace, and make progreſſe in Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Parents train up their Children in all knowledge, they can help them to, either in Learning, or Trades; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.18. ſo Miniſters are to adorn their people with ſuch Graces and Ornaments that they may give them up to Chriſt, as Brides fitted for him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2, 3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Miniſters are to provide for them an eternall Inheritance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. Parents lay up for their Children, they labour to get an Eſtate to leave to their Poſterity; ſo Miniſters are to lay up an eternall weight of glory for their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not onely to get them into Heaven, but to load them with an eternall weight of glory, fill them with patience and Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the graces of Gods Spirit, for the Spirit of glory reſts upon ſuch, he ſhould help them to grow in grace, that they might be filled with glory.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt, labour to help them to grow in Humility, a man muſt lay down all ambitious thoughts, or elſe he will never come to Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.2, 3. <hi>David</hi> could not get a Kingdome till he had learned to be like a weaned childe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. <hi>Jer.</hi> 45. <hi>ult.</hi> however we ſhall get but a poor piece of glory; the means to be exalted in Heaven, is to be humble here on Earth, an humble ſpirit ſhall be a glorious Soul; before Honour goes Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Labour to help them with patience and conſtancy, for if with well-doing they grow patient in ſuffering, and be ready to run through all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Chriſts Cauſe, and the Goſpel, great is their reward in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10, 11. reſt not when you have begotten them, and ſee ſome truth of grace wrought in them, but lay up for them a plentifull treaſure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; help them to be rich in grace, that they may be rich in glory at length.</p>
                     <p>Three Graces eſpecially goe to the attaining of the excellency of Glory, Zeal in doing Gods Will, Patience in ſuffering, and Humility in both; and Zeal breeds fruitfulneſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.17. &amp; 19. what was the reaſon, why he that gained more had a greater reward? becauſe he was more fruitfull with his Tallents, therefore it ſhould be the care of Miniſters to help
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65998:29"/>
their people (what in them lyes) to grow in theſe Graces.</p>
                     <p>We come now to the ſecond part, viz. the Declaration of the end of his writing, <hi>Theſe things I write that ye ſin not;</hi> now from this Declaration ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Point.</p>

                     <p>For here the Apoſtle anſwers an Objection which might ariſe, If the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin, then we may be bold to ſin, it is but run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Chriſts blood and we ſhall be cleanſed from our ſins; but he ſaith; <hi>I write theſe things that ye ſin not,</hi> therefore it implies that neither Law nor Goſpel ſhould encourage us to ſin, but reſtrain us.</p>
                     <p>The Law, that ſhews us the impoſſibility of not ſinning, but doth not teach us how to ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. it ſhews us ſin, and to ſhew ſin, is not to learne us how to ſin, but how to avoyd it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It ſhews us not only the nature of ſin, but alſo convinceth us of ſin, and the danger of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</p>
                     <p>And for the Goſpel, that teacheth that the blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all our ſins.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It ſhews a remedy againſt ſin, the blood of Chriſt, and the meanes, <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins,</hi> &amp;c. but it ſhewes withall that if we ſhall hereupon willingly commit ſin, we doe moſt ingratefully, and prophanely tread under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. we account it prodigality to deſpiſe precious things, how much more deſperate is it to deſpiſe the moſt precious blood of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Goſpel teacheth us ſo to uſe the blood of Chriſt, as that we may mortifie ſin, and not only get it pardoned, but cleanſed, for the uſe of the Goſpel is to mortifie ſin, therefore it leads us not to the commiſſion of ſin.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Goſpel begets thoſe graces that cleanſe us from ſin;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It begets faith, which purifies the heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It begets hope, and that alſo purifies, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. he that hath this hope purifies himſelfe, as he is pure.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It begets love, and that love conſtraines us to good, and reſtrains us from evill, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. ſo that both Law and Goſpel dehort us from ſin.</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Of direction to Miniſters what courſe to take.</p>
                     <p>Two points of Wiſdome are hence to be learned.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If any miſconſtruction may ariſe from your Doctrine, wiſely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, St. <hi>John</hi> ſaw there would ariſe an encouragement to ſin, from one Doctrine he had delivered, and a diſcouragement from fighting againſt ſin from another, therefore he tells them, <hi>Theſe things I write, that ye ſin not, but if any man ſin, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Another direction is, to frame your ſelves to diſpence Milk to Babes; Saint <hi>John</hi> was a Son of Thunder, and a Pillar among the Apoſtles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. yet he writing to little Babes, tells them thus, <hi>My little Children; theſe things I write unto you, that you ſin not;</hi> it ſeemes a weake line for ſuch a man, but he tempers his Doctrine according to their ſtrength; we ſhould be ready to thinke it poor homely ſtuffe to ſay thus, who could not have ſaid as much?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Of reproofe to the Papiſts, who lock up St. <hi>Johns</hi> writings from the people, they may not be ſuffered to read them; why if he write them for this end that they might not ſin, then they give the reins to ſin that deny leave and liberty to read them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. To teach us the poyſonful corruption of our natures, that out of the pureſt ſoundeſt Doctrine gathers poyſon, Saint <hi>John</hi> fore-ſaw that from his Doctrine they would be ready to gather falſe concluſions. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had delivered the free Doctrine of Juſtification, ſee what uſe they make of it, he had taught that as ſin abounded, ſo did grace much more
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65998:30"/>
abound, now he ſaw that they would be ready to gather falſe concluſions from this, therefore he prevents it, Chap. 6.1. ſhall we then ſin that Grace may abound? God forbid; therefore it muſt make us out of love with our ſelves; the commoneſt meats are moſt nouriſhing and good, other rare meats commonly breed diſtempers, but ſome ſtomach will corrupt any meat, ſo the plaineſt points of Religion, are the ſoundeſt and beſt, but ſuch is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature, that it is ready to gather poyſon out of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. To teach us when we have made a good uſe of the Apoſtles wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <hi>viz.</hi> when they divert us from ſin if you be reſtained and kept back from any ſin by them, you make good uſe of them, St. <hi>John</hi> wrote this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle that they might not ſin, labour therefore by reading thereof, to be made more cautelous againſt ſin.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If we can, to doe no ſin.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If we doe, to diſallow it, and hate it, and ſo it will be as no ſin to us.</p>
                     <p>We come now to the third point, <hi>viz.</hi> the conſolation, If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if he had ſaid, how can it be that we ſhould not ſin? he had taught the contrary, and told them he wrote thoſe things, that they might not ſin, but yet for all that, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their beſt care and indeavour, it could not be but they would ſin; but here is the comfort, if any man ſin we have an Advocate with the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he doth not ſay any man hath an Advocate with the Father, but I, and you, and ſuch as we are, we have an Advocate with the Father; now what is an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate? ſometimes it is applyed to the Holy Ghoſt, ſomtimes to the Son; to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.16. he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, both becauſe he is a Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and becauſe he is an Advocate, how? not in pleading our caſe before the Father, but by pleading in our hearts, in giving us the Spirit of Grace and Supplication, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. as in Law, he may be ſaid to be our Advocate that draws our petitions for us; the Holy Ghoſt doth not plead for us in heaven, but he draws our petitions for us, ſo that they are accepted in heaven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27. he doth ſpeak good things from God to us, and good things from us to God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.3. he tells us of our peace with God, and our comfort, and helps us to plead with God.</p>
                     <p>But properly it is the office of the Son, to be Advocate; an Advocate in Court, is a more ſpeciall pleader in the behalfe of another, whoſe perſon and cauſe is there to be judged of, and ſo Chriſt is our Advocate in ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the Father.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 He doth not fall down at his Fathers feet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he acts the part of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate by his preſence, at the Throne of Grace, ſo that his preſence cuts off many accuſations, it being known he is our friend, and ſtands for us, they dare not be ſo bold, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9, 24.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 He not only pleads for us by his preſence, but he intercedes for us by the merit of his blood, and that pleads more powerfully for us, than either ſin, or the Law, or Satan, or our own conſciences can plead againſt us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. <hi>His blood ſpeakes better things then the blood of Abel;</hi> that cryed for condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this for abſolution.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 He pleads for us, in giving us leave to uſe his name for our helpe, and his Spirit to plead for our ſelves, he ſends his Spirit to draw our petitions for us, and helpe us in his name ro plead for our ſelves, he is our chiefe Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, he ſends the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23, 24. and he promiſes, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. ſo that though the Spirit be an Advocate, yet he is ſent by Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 17.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 He plays the Advocate in our behalf, by expreſſing his good will towards us, to his Father, he declares his will to be, that we may be cleared from all doubts and be where he is, to behold his glory, this he did upon earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. and this very ſame doth he expreſſe for us in Heaven, and the reaſon of it is from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. where his mediation is made a diſtinct worke from his death, and reſurrection, and aſcention, and ſitting at his Fathers right hand; beſides all theſe, he makes requeſts for us in his own perſon, pleading to God for us for good things, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did oft for the people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.31, 32. and as it was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo it is ſaid it ſhould be with Chriſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> being a Mediatour, put in a word of Peace for the people, ſo doth Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But doth he thus intercede for every ſinner? no, he doth not ſay every man hath an Advocate, but <hi>we</hi> have, he did not intercede for all when he was upon the Earth, <hi>I pray not for the World, Joh.</hi> 17.9.20. for if Chriſt ſhould have prayed for all men, God would have heard him for all men, and then his death had been effectuall for all men, for he ſaith thou heareſt me alwayes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.42. Chriſt is not an Advocate for all, but only for the Children of God.</p>

                     <p>He is the Reconciliation as ſome tranſlations render it, but that expreſſeth not the full meaning, we muſt know therefore that Propitiation <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> includes Three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That he ſhould expiate our ſins, that is, make ſatisfaction for our Sins, a man may be a means of Reconciliation without ſatisfaction, but he cannot be Propitiation without offering ſatisfaction for the wrong done; now Chriſt did make ſatisfaction for our ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. and to make ſatisfaction, he did offer a ſatisfactory ſacrifice for our ſins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. he bearing the ſin and puniſhment due thereunto, it is as much as if we had done it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To be a Propitiation it is required, that he make peace and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for though a man ſometimes recompence and ſatisfie a wrong, yet the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65998:31"/>
Party wronged will not be at peace with him, and reconciled to him, but Chriſt hath taken upon him to reconcile God to us, ſo as that his wrath is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from us, and favour reſtored to us, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. now this reconciling im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies Three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That ſometimes we were friends with God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That we fell out with God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Being fallen out, we are reconciled again, and made at peace with him; Now this is procured by Chriſt, whereas we were once friends with God in Paradiſe and fell from him and his favour, Chriſt hath come and made up that breach, and reconciled us again.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When Chriſt is ſaid to be a Propitiation for our ſins, it implies, that he hath procured the manifeſtation of Gods favour to us, for ſuppoſe a Friend make ſatisfaction for another, and reconcilement with another with whom he is fallen out, yet if he know it not, his heart is as looſe as ever, but Chriſt hath not only procured us Gods favour, but he tells us, his Father is reconciled with us, and at peace with us, <hi>Job.</hi> 33.23. and 26. there is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Chriſts propitiation, that we ſhall ſee Gods face with joy, we ſhall pray to him with comfort, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, &amp;c.</hi> which ſhews, that he will bring rhem together, and there ſhall be a mutuall expreſſion of love to one another, and ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ſhment in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God ſhall take comfort in us, and we in him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. for that Chriſt goes further in this caſe than any man can.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Abſolom</hi> had offended his Father, in ſlaying his brother <hi>Ammon,</hi> well, he flyes away from his Fathers Court, <hi>Joab</hi> procures a Reconcilement, but yet he could not ſatisfie for the blood he had ſhed; he procured indeed ſo much that he was ſent for home by the King but yet ſaith the King, <hi>Let him returne to his own houſe, he ſhall not ſee my face,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.24. <hi>Joab</hi> could not ſatisfie for his blood, and the King would not ſee his face, ſo there wanted ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and manifeſtation of the Kings favour; well, afterwards manifeſtation was procured, but yet there wanted Propitiation, becauſe ſatisfaction could not be made; but Chriſt hath not only procured favour, but ſatisfaction, and hath declared his favour towards us. Now further, Chriſt hath done this, not only for the believing <hi>Jewes,</hi> but all Chriſtians all the World over, for to whom doth he ſpeake here? why to little Children, and what were they? why they were <hi>Jewes,</hi> as appears, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. who from the firſt giving of the Law were commanded to love one another; now beſides theſe weak <hi>Jewes,</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>He is our propitiation,</hi> including the Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>and not only ſo, but for the ſins of the whole World.</hi> Now the World is diverſly taken in Scripture;</p>
                     <p n="1">1 World is ſometimes put for the frame of Nature, as <hi>Act.</hi> 17.24.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It is ſometimes taken for the pleaſure and profits of the World, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It is ſometimes put for the wicked of the World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 It is ſometimes taken for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Jewes, Rom.</hi> 11.12.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 It is ſometimes taken for the Believers of the World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. though it may have further extent, but here it is taken in oppoſition to Chriſtian <hi>Jewes,</hi> he is not only a propitiation for the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but alſo for the believing <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But further, Chriſt is not only a Propitiation for his children, but for the whole World, that is, the whole body of the Creation, for as by <hi>Adams</hi> fall the whole World was curſed, Chriſt by his death renewed the bleſſing to the World again. the whole body of the Creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20. therefore it is ſaid, the whole body of the Creation waites for the liberty which the Sons of God have. A type of this we have in <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 8.20, 21. <hi>Noah</hi> being a Type of Chriſt, and making attonement for the World by Sacrifice, God ſmelt a ſweet favour, and doth promiſe that he would no more curſe the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65998:32"/>
earth for mans ſake, and that which was done by Type in him, is perfectly procured by Chriſt, all the creatures are encouraged to rejoyce in his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe they are Redeemed in him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.23. All the creatures are become the ſervants of Chriſt, ſubject to the dominion of Chriſt, he hath bought them all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. Chriſt is now Lord of all, he hath bought not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly us, but our Ground, and Cattle, and Houſes, and our Children, and he hath ſo purchaſed it, that the world ſhall be a bleſſing to the Church, the Tumults, and Agitations, and Diſorders, ſhall be for the good of his people.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Whether hath Chriſt made any propitiation for the wicked? for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates? how elſe for all the World?</hi>

                     <p n="2">2 I ſay that Chriſt hath laid down a ſufficient price for all, and thus much he hath procured Gods patience to forbeare them, and his bounty to lead them to Repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.45. yea he hath procured for them, not only gifts fitting them for Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, and the common Gifts and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Spirit, but many ſanctifying Gifts, ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.</p>

                        </gap> propitiation is required, not only that ſuch a ſatisfaction and reconciliation be propounded, but that they lay hold on it, as the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the old Law, who are they that had an attonement made by the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice they offered? only thoſe that laid their hands on the head of the ſacrifice, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.4. ſo then this is nothing for the propitiation of the Wicked, they do not lay hold on the head of Chriſt, they doe not take hold on him as an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate and propitiation; therefore they are left inexcuſable. This point is likewiſe handled by <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3.25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. the whole world was out with God, he purchaſed ſomething for all.</p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> The keeping of his Commandments is uſually in Scripture expreſt by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers compariſons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Sometimes it is expreſt by keeping his Commandments, as a man would keep his way, turning neither to the right hand, nor to the left, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.7. and then we muſt look at the Commandments as our way, as a Travellor doth not go out of his way, if he doth, it is beſides his intention.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65998:35"/>
men would be rich, but they would not always have it known, but a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is not only to look at Chriſts Commandments as his Treaſure, but as his ornaments and credit; a man is then ſaid to keep the Commandments; when he looks at them as his Treaſure and Ornaments, he fears not to ſhew himſelf, and let it appear that he keeps Chriſts Commandments, he is not aſhamed to wear them about him openly.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It is compared to the keeping of the apple of a mans eye, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.1, 2. keep them as the apple of thine eye; a man keeps the apple of his eye very tenderly, every moat is ready to trouble him, therefore he would not have the leaſt moat come into his eye; ſo, that is true keeping of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when the leaſt offence or ſcruple againſt Gods Commandments is b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="4">4 It is expreſt by keeping the Commandments as a man would keep his Soul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.16. as if it come to this pinch, either keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or loſe your life; a Chriſtian will loſe his life, and keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nay of the two, he would rather loſe his Soul, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. a man muſt be willing to ſit looſe from his life for Chriſt; now if we thus keep his Commandments, it is an evident ſigne that we know that we know him.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But ſuch a keeping is very ſtrict, and hardly to be attained, who can do this? in many things we offend all, and who is it that goes not aſtray?</hi>

                     <p n="2">2 After that he hath known ſin, he comes to know Chriſt and his mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch a man is ſenſible of his former miſery, and knows the excellencie of Chriſt, he hath been ſo bitten with ſin that he looks at it as the moſt hainous fight, and the keeping of Gods Commandments he looks at it as the ſweeteſt thing in the World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. Gods Commandments are not grievous to him, ſuch Knowledge ſprings from experience of our former miſery, therefore they that never come to this never knew Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Why is ſuch a man a lyar that ſaith he knows God, and keeps not his Commandments?</p>
                     <p n="1">1 From the conviction of the Teſtimony of that light which ſhines in his heart, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16 9. there is a Spirit of conviction, in all thoſe that live in the Church, for others do not contend that they know Chriſt, but thoſe that thus profeſſe, are convinced of their ſins, of their unbelief, and diſobedience, and of the wickedneſſe of their hearts and lives.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>Are there not many that live carnally and wickedly, and yet are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their ſins?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true there are ſuch, but then living in ſuch a courſe, they do not treſpaſs againſt their Conſciences, they think they keep the Law, and ſo think well of themſelves, and they are at peace and ſecure.</p>
                     <p>He that walks thus civilly and conformably, yet ſuch a mans Conſcience is at uncertainty about his Eſtate, he is convinced that he wants ſomething, but he cannot tell what it is, till he be throughly convinced by Gods Spirit,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65998:37"/>
thus it was, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.18, 19, 20. the young man told Chriſt all theſe have I kept from my youth, what lack I yet? his Conſcience guided him to feel that he wanted ſomething, though he had kept the Law in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward letter, yet he ſaw he wanted ſomething, and his Conſcience was not at reſt, ſo that ſuch a man as ſaith he knows Chriſt, and keeps not his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſpeaks againſt the conviction of his Conſcience, and therefore is a lyar; I ſpeak not of ſuch Chriſtians who want Peace becauſe they do not keep Gods Commandments, but of ſuch who when they have Peace think they keep his Commandments.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Why is there no truth of grace in ſuch a man as ſaith thus?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> From the neceſſary conjunction of all graces with obedience, no true grace of God but is either the cauſe of obedience, it breeds it, or elſe is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of obedience, or elſe an effect of obedience, it ſprang from obedience; Faith worketh by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. and love is the fullfilling of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. and ſo hope, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. patience is joyned with obedience, and meekneſſe ſprings from obedience; and from the ſpiritual experience of a mans weakneſſe and experience of Chriſts power, in him ſprings humility; ſo that all graces either ſpring from obedience, or ſerve to it, or accompany it; ſo that even theſe very graces that are more in the underſtanding and ſpeculation, they either ſpring from obedience, or help to obedience; the Knowledge of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is not unfruitful, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. which ſhews that a Chriſtians Knowledge brings forth fruits of obedience; no gift a Chriſtian hath but he conſiders what good he may do with it, and if he ſee it not ſerviceable he regards it not; ſo that if every grace do breed, or nurſe, or accompany obedience, then whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver profeſſes he knows God and doth not keep his Commandments, there is no truth in ſuch a man, no true grace.</p>

But yet we muſt here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the horror of ſin, and ſin it ſelf, the horror of ſin may be as bitter to us as death, but not the ſin it ſelf, as <hi>Judas,</hi> the horror of ſin was ſo bitter to him that for it he hanged himſelf; but had <hi>Judas</hi> been troubled with the ſin of his conſcience, as he was with the horror of his conſcience, he would not have gone about to help one ſin by another; had he hated ſin for it ſelf, he would have hated Murther as ſin. So would you know whether it be horror of ſin, or ſin that troubles you? If it be horror, you will ſeek to drive it away by ſin, as ſome do by merry company and merry Books, this is a plain ſigne that ſin troubles them not, for then they would not ſeek to help one ſin by another: but if a man look at the breach of the Law as the loſſe of his way, it troubles him as much as the loſing of his Treaſure, it is as a moat in his eye, he had as lieve part with his life, if it bee thus with thee thou mayeſt have comfort, thy profeſſion is true, thy conſcience clear, thy profeſſion ſound and ſincere.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Sincerity of obedience is called perfection, becauſe whatſoever is wanting is covered in the blood of Chriſt, and if a mans ſin be covered, it is as if he had no ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe wickedneſſe is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered; bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile;</hi> when there is ſo much uprightneſſe in a mans heart that he walks without any guile, to him the Lord imputes no ſin.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 Such are ſaid to be perfect, becauſe they ſtrive after perfection, and if they have a willing mind the Lord accepts of it, according to that a man hath, and not according to that a man hath not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. See how Chriſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the two Mites of the poor Widow, becauſe ſhe had an heart to give all her eſtate, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>She gave more than they all;</hi> ſo if a man gives all his heart to God, and if he had more he would give more, why, God accounts it as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 God accounts of any ſincere truth of grace as perfect, becauſe in time it will be ſo, and he looks at things to come as preſent, he that hath begun a good work will alſo perfect it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23, 24.</p>

them perfect colours that will hold their hue in every weather, now ſuch a true perfection of love to God is in all keepers of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 There is a perfection of all the parts of love in all ſuch men, there is none of the parts wanting; and the parts of love are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 An affection unto fellowſhip with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 An affection to be doing good to him.</p>
                     <p>What we love compleatly, Firſt, We deſire communion with it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We deſire communication of good thereunto; if we have it we rejoyce in it, if we want it we earneſtly deſire it; how doth a man know his love to his friend, but by deſire of communion with him, and communication of good to him, now ſuch a man as keeps Chriſts Commandments thus loves Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 He is broken off from the love of all other things, and he hath an unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affection to have fellowſhip with him, and to get that, he keeps his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and ſo dwells in him, and he in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21, 22.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 For communication of good to him, our works cannot profit God, yet if we be willing to do God any ſervice, to be at his command at any time, then the love of God is perfect in us, when we deſire fellowſhip with him, and deſire to do him the beſt ſervice we can.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Again in perfection there is a readineſſe to a work; ſo ſuch a man as keeps Gods Commandments, his love is ready, he is forward to every good duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a Commandment of God. He is a willing perſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. you need not ſtand urging him, he is willing to do Gods Will, <hi>His tongue is the pen of a ready writer,</hi> Pſal. 46.1.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 There is perfect love in him, becauſe it is conſtant and durable, and will not change, ſuch a mans love is the ſame in health and ſickneſſe, in the Church and at home, in proſperity and adverſity, and if it be any way diſturbed at any time, yet it will return again to its former conſtant courſe.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>But how may I know, wherein doth it appear, that if I keep Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, my love is perfect?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. From the contrariety of our tempers naturally to any Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo thnt if you ſee any one willing and ready to be at Gods command, you may ſay, certainly the love of God hath overcome him, the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God do croſſe his will, croſſe his affections, croſſe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s profit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo that if you ſee any one give himſelf up to keep Gods Commandments and croſſe himſelf, it is an undoubted ſign that there is the love of God in him, which conſtrains him to do what Nature would not do.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 You may know ſuch a mans love to be perfect that keeps his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe whatſoever weak beginnings of love you finde in ſuch as keep Gods Commandments, that mans love grows perfecter every day, ſuch a man ſtill grows in fruitfulneſſe, he grows ready to every good work, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2. ſo that the love of God is perfected in him by obedience; As a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Tree, the more it ſticks his root downward into the ground, the faſter it grows, ſo a Chriſtian, the more he ſticks his root on Chriſt, the faſter it grows. And ſo the Husbandman will have more care of a fruitful Tree to prune it, he hath no ſuch care of a ſower barren Tree, but if a Tree be fruitful, he cuts off all ſuperfluous Boughs that hinder the increaſe of ſuch a Tree, ſo a man that is fruitful in Gods Commandments, he doth not only ſtick his root, his faith and hope deeper in Chriſt, but the Lord himſelf is willing to cut down all thoſe noyſome Luſts that ſuck away the ſap of grace; if God ſee a man ſet himſelf fully to follow God, and keep his Commandments, the Lord will cut off all cumberances, all corruptions, all things that hinder the growth of grace.</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For trial of our love to God, whether it be perfect or no, whether ſincere or counterfeit; how doſt thou finde thy heart affected to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? Doſt thou look at them as thy way? it grieves thee to be out,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65998:39"/>
doſt thou look at them as thy treaſure, as moſt profitable to theee? Doſt thou look at them as thy ornaments, as moſt honourable to thee?

If thou doſt, thou haſt that love in thee that is perfect without guile, perfect in every part of love, and in regard of readineſſe and conſtancie; but if a man looks at Gods Commandments as a by-path, as if he were out of the way; if he looks at them as unprofitable, and diſhonourable, if he can break them without any ſcruple, if he would rather part with them all than his life, verily the love of God is not perfect in ſuch.</p>
                     <p>

For direction to all ſuch as deſire perfection of love to Chriſt; do any deſire to love the Lord Jeſus in perfection, not only of truth, but parts, and degrees, if he could? Why this is the way, keep his Commandments, take heed of breaking any one of them. What is the reaſon we deceive our ſelves in our love to Chriſt? We think it is love to Chriſt, if we keep a ſolemn Feaſt to him at this time of the year in memory of his Nativity, but is there no better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, nor furtherance of thy love to Chriſt than this? Take heed of it, if Chriſt hath commanded us to deck our bodies and houſes, if Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to feaſt and be liberal, you will finde that a great help to further your love to Chriſt, and an evidence thereof; but if you go on in any courſe without a Commandment, if you keep ſuch Feaſts, which end in all exceſſe and ryot, and gaming and playing, they begin it may be, pretty well, but we fall from Religion to civility, from civility to intemperance, and wantonneſſe, &amp;c. and what is the reaſon? Becauſe we have the cuſtom of our Fathers for it, not the Commandment of Chriſt; the Apoſtle doth not ſay, he that keeps cuſtoms his love is perfect, but he that keeps Chriſts Commandments, therefore if you would get your love to Chriſt perfected, it muſt not be by keeping of old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, but by keeping his Commandments: what is the reaſon why the moſt are ſo ready to keep ſuch Feaſts, is it becauſe it is Chriſts Commandment? if it were, the more you would find your love perfected, you would be more forward to good, your ſpirits grow from one grace to another, but becauſe men look at cuſtoms, they begin in the Spirit and end in the Fleſh. Take a Chriſtian at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Sabbath, he findes his heart unlifty to holy Dutie, but before it be ended, he is ſo enlarged, that he is ſorry it is done? Why, becauſe he obeys a command, but if we do any thing out of cuſtom, it grows from better to worſe, ſo that Chriſt hath not more diſhonour the reſt of the twelve Months than he hath theſe twelve days; but would you have your love perfected, then frame your lives and courſes according to Gods Commandments, and then the more you practiſe the more you may, you ſhall finde your grace growing, and your love perfected to every good work; be doing Gods will, and the Lord will be with you, bleſſed is that ſoul whom the Lord ſhall finde doing his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; be doing, and your doing ſhall multiply your ſtrength and growth in grace.</p>

                     <p>Queſt. 1 <hi>What is it to be in Chriſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> We are ſaid to be in Chriſt, in Scripture-phraſe by three degrees.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 They are ſaid to be in Chriſt, that do ſubmit themſelves to the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, hear the Word, receive the Sacrament, uſe prayer and other good duties, and live unblameably before his people, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.39. where he gives li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to any Chriſtian woman that makes profeſſion of Religion, if her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band be dead, to marry with whom ſhe will, but in the Lord, and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.11. he forbids <hi>Timothy</hi> to receive younger widdows; becauſe when they begin to wax wanton againſt Chriſt, they will marry; this is not here meant, though it be a part of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 There is a further being in Chriſt by a participation of ſome Graces, though not ſanctifying Graces; yet ſuch as may fit them for many Chriſtian Offices, as may fit for Magiſtry, as <hi>Jehu,</hi> Miniſtry, as <hi>Judas, Joh.</hi> 15.2. Every branch that beareth not fruit in me, he taketh away; as who ſhould ſay there may be a branch in Chriſt, and yet bring forth no fruit, but no man can bee thus in Chriſt, but he muſt ſuck ſome ſap and juice from Chriſt; but this is not here meant of common Graces, as <hi>Jehues</hi> zeal, <hi>Felix</hi> his trembling, <hi>Herods</hi> joy, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Men are ſaid to be in Chriſt, when they participate of ſuch Graces as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſalvation; ſuch as make them true Members of Chriſt, as Faith, and Humility, and Hope, and Patience; and of ſuch St. <hi>John</hi> here ſpeaks, by ſuch fruits we know that we are in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>And thus we are ſaid to be in Chriſt, partly from all eternity, in the purpoſe of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. not actually, but vertually, <hi>non actuali inexiſtentia, ſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuali continentia,</hi> God looked at us as Members, in time to be in Chriſt, and notwithſtanding this decree, yet theſe may not live in obedience to any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, have as yet no Fellowſhip with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 There is another being in Chriſt, which is actuall, namely, of ſuch, who
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65998:40"/>
being called out of the eſtate of Nature, bring forth the fruits of new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. who were in Chriſt before me, not elected before him, but called before him, he was a Perſecutor when they were Profeſſors; thus we are ſaid to be in Chriſt, when by faith we lay hold on him, <hi>John</hi> 1.12.</p>
                     <p>Q. 2. <hi>What is it to know we are in Chriſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> It is more than opinion, or thinking ſo, for we are never ſaid in any ſpeech to know that which we only think to be ſo, no man knows this to be gold or ſilver, if he but think it to be ſo. No man grounds his knowledge upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, and indeed opinion flows from contingencie, it may be ſo, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but Knowledge is on ſure grounds; what then, is it Faith? No, they go together, yet they differ much, there is as much difference between them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween hearing and ſeeing, <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> when we aſſent to any thing upon Divine teſtimony, as if God hath given us ſome word, we believe it, but if we ſee a thing by ſenſe, or by experience, or by ſome certain Arguments of Gods dealing with us, that we do not now only believe it from Gods Word, but we plainly ſee it by experience in our hearts from ſome love of God, from ſome obedience and humility, &amp;c. if we have found our conſciences pacified af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much horrour: Again, we finde that our hearts have been proud and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, but now down falls pride and uncleanneſſe, and we begin to conform our ſelves to Gods will, now we know that Chriſt is in us, or elſe we could not have turned our ſelves to any good thing.</p>
                     <p>Q. 3. <hi>What is the reaſon that ſuch obedience is a certain ſign and evidence of our good eſtate in Chriſt, that we know that we are in Chriſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the wonderful inſufficiency of our natures to keep any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God without this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.34, 35. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. we of our ſelves are altogether fruitleſſe in the works of righteouſneſſe, till Chriſts love dwell in us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. to 27. How come men to keep Gods Law but from the Spirit of God which dwels in them? Look on men in the ſtate of Nature, and their faireſt fruits are but the Vines of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and Grapes of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> Deut. 32.32, 33. they ſeem as fair as any, but their cluſters are bitter, and ſo the beſt fruits of all Natural men are bitter, our very Honey is like Gall, and Wormwood, and our beſt actions full of corruption and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo that if a man finde his Grapes ſavoury, his words, thoughts, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons gracious and ſweet, ſo that now he is fruitful in obedience, it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſign we are in Chriſt, elſe we could not be enabled to any thing which is good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Were it not for the love of Chriſt that conſtraineth us, we ſhould never be willing to deny our ſelves; Do you ſee a man willing to ſubmit himſelf to Chriſt, to his Ordinances, it could not be but by the love of Chriſt, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains us to deny our ſelves.</p>

Why doth the Apoſtle ſpeak to little Children Babes in Chriſt thus, they may know that they are in Chriſt, and that by keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſincerity, if it were impoſſible to be known? for them therefore to conclude an impoſſibility for a man to know that he is in Chriſt, is againſt the Doctrin of the Apoſtles, and againſt Chriſt,; if (I ſay) any man preach another Goſpel than this that St. <hi>John</hi> delivered, let him bee accurſed <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7.</p>

ſtate of Grace, becauſe he was willing to deny his deareſt Son for Chriſt. He anſwers, it may be it was ſpecial Revelation, but it was not ſpecial Revelation, to reſolve to kill his Son at Gods command, he knew his own heart well enough.</p>

Now we have received not the Spirit of the World but the Spirit of God, that we might know the things that are given us of God; ſo then ſaith he, if we may know things that are given us by the Spirit of God, then it is more than conjecture, it is a certain Knowledge. His anſwer to this is, it is ſpoken of a ſtate of Glory but it is manifeſt to be meant of a ſtate in this life; for he ſpeaks of Princes that perſecuted the truth, and that they knew not theſe things, but we know it by the Spirit of God.</p>

If men may diſcern they are in darkneſſe, when they are in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; much more may we know we are in light, when we are in light, of the two, it is the eaſier: now he that is in the ſtate of darkneſſe, knows it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. the works of the fleſh are manifeſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 He ſaith thoſe things which are in a man eſſentially, he knows they are in him: now Graces are eſſential in a regenerate man, that is, the eſſence of them is there, therefore he may know that Repentance and Faith, &amp;c. is there: if they be there, what is in a man, is known to be in him: if he have a judgment, he knows he hath it: if he hath a will, he knows he wills: ſo if a man hath Graces in him, he may know that he hath them, as a Woman with child, doth know that ſhe is with child, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1. and takes it not upon others report, but upon her own ſure Knowledge: ſo if Chriſt be conceived in us, the ſtirring motions of Gods Graces be in us, we may know it, thus <hi>Aquinas</hi> confutes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

That the grace of Chriſt might be as largely extended to all ſorts of men, as the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> was extended to all degrees and ages, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. to 18. if <hi>Adam</hi> had defiled all ſorts and Chriſt had reſtored but ſome ſort of men, only young men, then <hi>Adams</hi> ſin had been more powerful to deſtroy, than Chriſts righteouſneſſe to ſave; it was meet therefore that as <hi>Adam</hi> defiled all Ages, all conditions, ſo Chriſt ſhould reſtore all Ages, all conditions, and ſanctifie them: as there are of all ſorts that are defiled, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.17, 18. all Ages wholly corrupted, the Father kindles the Fire, the Women kneads the Dough, and the children gather ſticks, to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven; now as there are of all ſorts thus corrupted, ſo it is meet there ſhould be of all ſorts ſanctified; why ſhould not God have all ſorts to ſerve him, as well as the Queen of Heaven?</p>

                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. From the honour that is returned to God by the ſeveral ages.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 For old men, they bring this honour to God, whether they be called in old age, or before, and hold on.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Herein God glorifies the truth of his promiſe, that length of dayes is in the right hand of Wiſdom (by Wiſdom is meant the fear of the Lord) on this ground he encourageth his Son to Wiſdom, that it will be a means to lengthen his dayes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.16. therefore that God might juſtifie this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, he will have ſome old men ſtand up before him, it doth not make them ſo melancholly that they ſhorten their days, Religion diſtempers no man, godly ſorrow never waſted our days, but worldly ſorrow: <hi>Haman</hi> the <hi>Ezra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hite,</hi> was wonderfully addicted to godly ſorrow, yet he grew up to his old age, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.8. Riches, and honour, and long life are the reward of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.4. Wealth and credit, and length of dayes happen oft to them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 When you ſee old men continue in their profeſſion to their old age, they put an honour on Religion; if young men and children only ſhould profeſſe Religion, you would take it as indiſcretion and hotneſſe of Spirit, but doe you ſee any grave wiſe old man take up a Chriſtian courſe? none doe it but young Punies that know not what they doe, this would be a great diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that God may make it known, that wiſdom and diſcretion is to be found in the wayes of grace, therefore he will have ſome old men walke in thoſe ways, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.31. that grey hairs may honour Religion, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be a crown to them; Eighty ſix years, ſaid old <hi>Ignatius,</hi> have I ſerved God, and yet never found him a hard maſter; ſo when Chriſtians can ſay, ſo many years have I ſerved God, and if it had been ſuch a weariſome courſe they would have ſhaken it off, but when we ſee they hold out in it, it implies they find ſome comfort and joy therein, and if old men come on, it will be ſaid, they now ſee by experience the vanity of all other courſes, they ſee it is beſt dying a chriſtian, and ſpending our laſt days in chriſtianity, old men would never fall into it, unleſſe they ſaw there is no way ſo comfortable and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as that is.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 For young men, it is a great bonour to Religion if they come on, they make the power of Chriſts grace manifeſt, that is able to overcome the heat and violence of youthful luſts, no age ſo violent and boyſterous in corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo head-ſtrong, ſo indiſcreet and raſh, ſo that what for unrulineſſe, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſſe, vanity, pleaſure, they are moſt indiſpoſed to grace, and will not hold on: if God therefore take hold of their Spirits, and ſtabliſh their Spirits, when they by Gods Grace ſhall be able to rule their Spirits, their luſts, to rule their hearts, this argues the ſtrength of grace, in that, when neither wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, nor Magiſtrate can rule them, yet the grace of Chriſt can rule them, rule
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65998:52"/>
their paſſions, ſo that they can put forth their ſtrength againſt the enemy, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt their own corruptions, or abuſes of others, ſo that when the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſit ſtill, ſometimes a young <hi>Phineas</hi> riſes up, and ſhews his zeal for Chriſt, what an honour is this to Chriſts grace? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and youth are vanity, ſo that if Gods grace can lay hold on them, and reſtrain them, the power of Gods grace is hereby magnified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2, 3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. youth is only ſtrong in weakneſs, if Gods grace therefore ſhall be ſo ſtrong as to ſubdue all theſe, and make them like unto <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who at ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age ſet himſelfe to ſeek God, and compelled the whole Land to do ſo, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.33. (he compelled them at leaſt to outward Reformation) it is a great glory to God, when young men thus give up their young dayes to God</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Another Honour they bring to God, is by their boldneſſe and courage in a good cauſe; old men ſometimes, though wiſe yet are too cautelous and backward, but young men, what is wanting in experience they have in zeale, they are forward in any ſervice for God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 And for Babes and Children, if they be brought to grace, God hereby caſts ſhame on elder men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.7. when they ſee Bahes come off with more ſavoury words than old men, ſometimes God confounds the folly of ancient men by the wiſdome and grace in Children; when Chriſt came riding to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the Children cried out, Hoſanna, and praiſed him, the High Prieſts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained it; but, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.16, 17. Chriſt told them, have ye not read, that <hi>out of the mouthes of Babes and ſucklings thou haſt perfected thy praiſe?</hi> This is to ſtill the enemy and revenger; they ſhame you that are Elders and Prieſts; in regard of your backwardneſſe. Thus we ſee, God will have of all ſorts and ages of men ſtand up to doe him ſervice.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 It helps to make a right uſe of what we hear; yea it ſets ſuch an edge on the Word heard, that though the preaching did not ſo throughly affect, yet by reading, they come to quicken Faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11, 12. though the Word prepared their hearts, and made them attentive; yet till againe they read, and reviſed, and meditated on what they had heard, their Faith was in ſuſpence, but after they ſaw the agreement of his publick Doctrin with the word, then many of them beleeved, not that God doth ordinarily beget Faith by reading, without hearing; but when we have heard, reading exceedingly quickens our ſpirits and Faith.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 There is a further benefit from reading the Word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.19.20. a man ſhall find himſelfe thereby framed to the fear of God, to humility, &amp;c. that day a man neglects reading of the Word of God, he ſhall find his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit more looſe and unbridled, leſſe conſcionable, he doth not ſtand in awe ſo much.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 It is a means to confirm us, and eſtabliſh and help our memories, and ſtir us up to holy dutyes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 It makes the Word more ready in times of temptation, what a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous uſe our Saviour made of the Word, when Satan tempted him? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.17. a man in temptation, will find need of many paſſages of Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Laſtly, another uſe of reading the Scriptures is, that our joy may be full, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.4. reading doth fill our hearts with comfort and conſolation, not that reading is ſufficient to ſalvation, no ordinance roots out another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. Faith comes by hearing, but though that eſpecially begets faith, yet for ſundry other Graces, reading is of ſpeciall uſe, at leaſt to quicken and ſtir up grace; we do not read that God ever bleſſed reading alone to beget Faith, for God doth not uſually bleſſe it alone, but when it is joyned with hearing the Word preached; in any congregation where there is only reading of the Word, what one ſoul is begot to God, comes on to Faith, to Gods fear, to humility, to patience, &amp;c. not but that in ſuch places be found good Chriſtians, but it is, becauſe they goe abroad, otherwiſe it fares with reading, as with the Eunuch, that knew not what he read, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.30, 31. till <hi>Philip</hi> declared the interpretation. But yet I ſay, you old men read, and you young

men read, and you Children read, and it is a great fault to neglect it, and put it over wholly to little Children, as a petty childiſh exerciſe; but what, doth St. <hi>John</hi> write only to Babes? no, but he writes to young men, and therefore they are to read what he writes; and to old men, and therefore they are to read what he writes, when God laid the charge upon the Kings of <hi>Iſrael, Deu.</hi> 17.19. he did not impoſe it only upon Babes, but whatſoever their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be, whether they be in war, or ſitting in the ſeat of Judgment, they muſt let no day paſſe without reading the Law; no perſon, but let him read; we ſhall underſtand the Word better, and the better remember it, we ſhall be more ſtirred up to fear God, to keep his Law, we ſhall be the better fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed againſt many temptations, which otherwiſe will prevail againſt us; In a word, ſeeing he wrote to them that they might learn to walke as Chriſt walked, hence you may comfortably expect, by reading the Word, by laying it up, by praying for a bleſſing, you may be helped to walke even as Chriſt walked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I write unto you Fathers, becauſe you have known him that was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> Who are theſe Fathers? they are ſuch as are oppoſed to young men and Babes; therefore he ſpeaks of old men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.2, 3. why doth he call them Fathers? not that they were his Fathers to beget him to God: for before he had called them Brethren; neither is it meant of his natural Father, but he calls them ſo, even out of very reverence to their age.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Then he puts them to queſtion their Faith and Adoption, whether they be Gods Children or no? their ſtrong luſts make them doubt of it, and if Gods Grace break through this,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He tempts them about their ſanctification, he will fill their hearts with unclean luſts; and if a man break through theſe, he hath much cauſe to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie Gods Grace.</p>

to grow ſtrong againſt him, watch warily againſt him, that the evill one touch you not.</p>
                     <p>And there are three eſpeciall Graces to help young men againſt the aſſaults of Satan.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Sobriety; watch to Sobriety, be ſober and vigilant, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. take heed of intemperancy, and inconſtancy.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Treaſure up the grace of Humility, that you think not highly of your ſelves, which is the folly of youth; <hi>God reſiſts the proud, and gives grace to the humble.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And there are three Duties which I commend to young men.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Diligence in your Callings: the want of which overthrew <hi>David;</hi> when he was idle, Satan took advantage to tempt him to uncleannes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.12.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Frequency in Gods ordinances, in reading and hearing the Word, <hi>v.</hi> 14. the more you treaſure up the Word, the more power and ſtrength you have againſt Satan, and the more you receive the Sacrament, the more ſtrength you get, for this is the end of receiving the Sacrament, to get ſtrength againſt your luſts.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Q. 1. <hi>What is it to overcome Satan?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> It is a borrowed ſpeech from the Victory of Souldiers in War, and Souldiers overcome either by killing their enemy, or ſpoyling, or captivating, or putting to flight their enemies, now Satan cannot be put to death, he is a Spirit, and ſo is not capable of death, onely of the ſecond death.</p>
                     <p>And to lead him captive, that Victory is onely peculiar unto Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. <hi>He led captivity captive.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for the two laſt, ſo young-men may overcome Satan, they may ſpoile him, and put him to flight, for ſpoyling, Chriſt hath done the worſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. he hath ſpoyled Satan. But,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For putting him to flight, Young men may doe this, <hi>James</hi> 4.7. which implies, that there is a poſſibility in young men, and a power to ſtand, and not to yield to his temptations; for though he hath a power to delude our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and may hurry a mans body about, yet he cannot captivate our Wills, therefore ſtand, reſiſt, give no place, and if you doe ſo, he will fly from you for ſhame, he hath no power longer to hold out, when he ſees a man ſtand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; God hath not given him liberty to purſue us unto death, but if we ſtand out againſt him, he will fly from us. So it was with our Saviour, firſt he tempted him about his Son-ſhip, <hi>If thou be the Son of God command that theſe ſtones be made bread;</hi> then he tempted him to preſumption, to caſt himſelfe down from the Pinacle of the Temple; and then he tempted him with the glory of the World, <hi>All theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me;</hi> but becauſe our Saviour ſtill reſiſted his temptations, and Satan could not prevail, he departed; if a man ſtand out ſtrongly, Satan flies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if a man yield never ſo little, he makes uſe of the leaſt advantage, and will preſſe it; but if you ſtand faſt, and yield not, he will be gone from you, his very pride and inſolency makes him ſcorne to trouble himſelfe with any Creature, he diſdains to be overcome by him, therefore he will depart. Thus
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65998:56"/>
                        <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſtrongly aſſaulted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. but he reſiſts and anſwers with much affection, <hi>How can I doe this great wickedneſſe and ſin againſt God?</hi> He had long reſiſted and ſtood out againſt the temptations of his Miſtreſſe, and therefore ſhe no more ſolicites him with that thing, but takes another courſe, falſly to accuſe him to his Maſter, and ſo cauſed him to be caſt into priſon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Young-man may not onely put him to flight, but he may alſo ſpoyl Satan, that is, he may take advantage by his aſſaults, to grow more wary, more holy, more obedient, more fruitfull, and ſo he ſpoils Satan; if a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian enrich his ſpirit by the temptations he meets with, he makes a ſpoile of Satan; the riches of the Souldier is the ſpoil of the Enemy: when young men ſtand faſt, and make a ſpoil of Satan, and grow more humble, and meek, and obedient, they ſhall ſo much the more overcome Satan; <hi>Job</hi> was ſtrongly temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Satan to blaſpheme God, but yet he ſtands faſt, and not onely ſo, but takes occaſion to bleſſe God, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. ſo when Satan tempts him by his wife, ſee how he anſwers, <hi>Job</hi> 2.10. <hi>Michal</hi> tempts <hi>David</hi> by deriding him, when he danced before the Ark, but he grew more zealous by it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.20, 21. ſo <hi>John</hi> 3.26. They would have ſtirred up <hi>John</hi> to emulate Chriſt, but that ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him up to magnifie him more than ever he did before, and give the moſt honourable Teſtimony of him.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>How come young men to overcome Satan?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the bloud of the Lamb, his power is queld by the death of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the power of the Word that dwells in them, <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By the power of the Spirit, that is ſtronger in them, than he that is in the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3, 4.</p>

Our Saviour was much moved, when they forbad little Children to be brought unto him, and when the chiefe Prieſts and the Scribes took it ill, that the Children cryed out after Chriſt, <hi>Hoſannah, thou Son of David,</hi> he told them it was written, <hi>Out of the mouthes of babes and ſucklings haſt thou perfected praiſe,</hi> Mat. 21.15. therefore let not ſuch a Proverb paſſe, if they prove old Devills they were never young Saints, but young Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites it may be.</p>

                     <p>If it were extraordinary it would not be ſo common; and this indeed may juſtly diſcourage us from Religion: that woman that holds it impoſſible that her Childe ſhould know his Father, is a Strumpet; ſo that Church that holds her children cannot know their Father, is an Harlot, becauſe they worſhip ſo many gods, they know not of what ſeed they be, for if they were begotten of the Seed of the Word, hereby we might conclude, we know that we know him, becauſe we keep his Word; neither let them put it off, and ſay, We have a conjecturall knowledge, but not a certain knowledge, for when we ſay we know ſuch a thing, we doe not ſay we think it; Opinion breeds conjecture, but Knowledge breeds certainty; <hi>Contingentium eſt opinio, neceſſariorum &amp; certorum eſt ſcientia,</hi> whether it be <hi>à cauſis</hi> or <hi>effectis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſay they, This Doctrin breeds preſumption.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, No Doctrine makes us more circumſpect than to know that God is our Father, and if we grow ſecure, God will ſhew he is a Father as well to correct, as to ſhew indulgence.</p>

under the Law the eighth day; if they did but as well know God as ſome of theſe little Children, they would not hold ſuch an opinion ſo contrary to Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It reproves elder people, if they doe not know God to be their Father, if even Babes may know God to be their Father, if they know him ſo ſoon why doe we neglect it? St. <hi>John</hi> writes it as an ornament to Children, that they know their Father, and it may ſhame elder people, if Children in this point go beyond them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. It may teach little Children, that God looks at it as their duty, to know God their Father; you have known your Naturall Fathers thus long, and why ſhould you not know God the Father of Eternity? you might hereby honour God, and confute elder men; you have entred into Covenant, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fly not back; you have received the Seals of the Covenant, therefore give up your ſelves unto God, and labour to know him to be your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. For Parents, and Governours of Children, if little Children may know God their Father, then learn them to know him to be their Father, and the Church their Mother; fill their heads with knowledge of God, learn them to love God, and rejoyce in him, and delight in his ways in ſome meaſure.</p>
                     <p>Motives hereunto.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In reſpect of God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, From Gods command, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. take all good occaſions, dull them not, a little and often will bring them on; the water falling drop by drop hollows a Flint, ſo by dropping now and then a little, you will learn them the knowledge of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From Gods acknowledgement of it, and his Promiſe to reveal himſelfe to ſuch Parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In reſpect of Children, they are capable either to ſcoff, as the Children that mockt <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 Kings 1. or to cry <hi>Hoſannah,</hi> Matth. 21.15. though they be not ſo eaſily brought on to that which is good, yet they are not ſo corrupt then, as when they are grown up to more years.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In reſpect of Parents, it is an irrecompenſible injury you offer to your Children, if you have begot them into the World ſinfull and wicked, as we are by nature, and doe not ſeek by all means to redreſſe this evill, they will cry out againſt you for Judgement; therefore that they may not curſe you at the laſt day, let it be your care to bring them up in the knowledge and fear of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>What courſe may we take thus to redreſſe young Infants?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Teach them the Principles of Religion, their Baptiſm, that will teach them they are unclean by Nature, and that they are cleanſed by the Bloud of Chriſt; they were Baptized into the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, therefore learn them to know God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, and that will make them think of it, when they ſee others bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Train up a Childe in his way wherein he ſhould walk, and he will keep it to the end;</hi> nurture him, or initiate him in the trade of his way, in the original it is, <hi>in the mouth of his way,</hi> that is, at the beginning of his way, ſet him right at the firſt in his way, and he will keep to the end; if a Travellor be ſet right in his way at firſt, it will help him the better to keep his way all his Journey; ſo ſet a Childe in a good way, learn him to ceaſe from evill, and to doe well, and he will the better keep that way in his age, as <hi>David</hi> teacheth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.11, to 15.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Learn them to read the Scriptures, and be converſant therein, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4, 5. &amp; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. reading brings much benefit to little Children.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Bring them to Church, and help them to remember ſomething, and tell them the meaning of it, and take a little in good part, and encourage them, and that will make them delight in it.</p>

                  <p>Why doth he not reckon Babes too here? why? becauſe they were not ſo eaſily carried away with the world; but he writes to old men, and young men, who ſeeing they knew God, and had overcome the wicked one, they ſhould not love the world; but to little children he writes, <hi>v.</hi> 18. to <hi>beware of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements of falſe Doctrins.</hi>

                     <p>Two things there were which made wiſe, ancient, cautelous men, not to embrace Chriſt, and his Goſpel.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="2">2. The Authority of Heathen Emperours that gain-ſaid it. Now to remove theſe impediments, the Apoſtle layes down this as a means, <hi>Love not the world,</hi> implying, that it was love of the world that made them to embrace that ancient Religion, and reject Chriſt, therefore he writes unto them, <hi>Love not the world;</hi> and that they might doe this, he tells them, <hi>that they knew him that was from the beginning, the Ancient of dayes,</hi> and all other Religions are but novelties.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Here are two Cauſes of their Victory over the wicked one, that is, their ſtrength, and the abiding of the Word in them. For the firſt,</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="doctrine">
                     <head>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> Spirituall ſtrength in Young men, it is a grace highly acknowledged of Gods ſervants.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.29. <hi>The glory of Young-men is their ſtrength;</hi> but the Apoſtle ſpeaks not here of bodily ſtrength, but ſuch ſtrength whereby they overcome the wicked one, and this he acknowledgeth in them.</p>
                     <p>Q. 1. <hi>What is this ſtrength?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is the power of Gods Spirit, whereby a Chriſtian is inabled to do all Spirituall duties in the power of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is a power of Gods Spirit, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. and hereby he is inabled to doe all ſpirituall duties, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                     <p>A Chriſtian man, younger or elder, is able to perform every Chriſtian duty, he is able to doe all duties, and ſuffer for Chriſt, with power.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It inables a man to doe every Chriſtian duty with ſtrength, and ſo to doe implies three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 When a man performes a thing in ſtrength he performes it chearfully, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.5. <hi>The Sun rejoyceth to run his courſe,</hi> &amp;c. if a man runs through his work with chearfulneſſe it is a ſign of ſtrength, <hi>John</hi> 4.34. Chriſt accounted it his meat and drink to doe his Fathers will, he took as much delight in it, and it was his ſtrength that made him doe ſo.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Doing the Will of God with ſtrength implies a ſpirit of boldneſſe and courage, that they are not fearfull, but go on with courage and boldneſſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.13. &amp; 19.20. they were ſtrengthened by Chriſts power.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Strength makes a man doe Gods Will diligently, and conſtantly; an old man is ſoon wearied, and ſlacks, but take a ſtrong man, and he does his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe diligently and conſtantly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. and painfully, he doth things with dexterity, and he that hath ſtrength doth things conſtantly, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and perſeverance. Let a Childe ſhoot an Arrow with a weak hand, it waggles, but if a ſtrong man ſhoots it, it goes evenly; ſo if a weak man take a duty in hand, he begins to lagge, and fail, but a ſtrong Chriſtian he does duties conſtantly.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For Sufferings; ſtrength of grace appears in bearing all things patiently, and joyfully, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. when a man therefore is able to doe duties with chearfulneſſe, and ſuffer with patience, he is endued with the power of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is a ſtrength required for the over-coming and ſtanding out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Satan, when a man is not onely able to doe and ſuffer valiantly, but is ready and able alſo to hold out, and reſiſt all temptations, <hi>James</hi> 4.7. and makes advantage thereof, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.20. <hi>John</hi> 3.26. this argues much ſtrength, when a man can go on in power and vigour, notwithſtanding Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                     <p>Q. 2. <hi>Why doth God vouchſafe Young-men this ſtrength, and not old men, and children?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. Becauſe they are to wraſtle with ſtronger Luſts, which old men are paſt, and children are not come to; young men are ſure to be tranſported with ſtrong luſts, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23. even thoſe who are of a weak and abſtemious nature, much more thoſe that are of a ſtrong conſtitution, therefore God gives young men ſuch ſtrength to reſiſt againſt theſe ſtrong luſts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Their Temptations are ſtronger from without, they are more apt to be carried away with company, and worldly buſineſſe, and pleaſures, old men are not fit, but young men are more ſtrongly carried with profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; therefore that God might ſhew his might in them, he ſtrengthens them,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65998:59"/>
and indeed the Devil loſes more by one young man that breaks off from him, than by ſix or ſeven old men, or twenty Children; for luſtfull ſtrong youths to break off, weakens Satan moſt, and doth God moſt ſervice, and therefore Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan aſſaults them moſt; therefore the Apoſtle writes unto them with honour, <hi>I write unto you young men, becauſe you are ſtrong.</hi>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> It may ſerve to exhort all young men, to labour for this Spiritual ſtrength; the ſtrength of young men is their honour, to be able to over-run, and out-wraſtle others, but what is that, if he be not able to out-run the World, and his Luſts? what is it to out-wraſtle his Adverſary, if he cannot out-wraſtle Satan, and his Temptations, and his own Corruptions? for a young man to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the world, and himſelf, is a greater Victory than <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great could reach unto; what a comely and honourable thing is it for a young man to out-wraſtle Satan, the World, his own Luſts? and God to this end hath made his Ordinance ſtrong, his Spirit is ſtrong, the Lords Supper is Meat indeed, and Drink indeed to ſtrengthen us, and ſhall we have ſuch ſtrong means, and ſhall we be led away, and overcome with every company? no, it is the honour of young men to be ſtrong againſt temptation, to do Gods Will, to ſuffer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, to hold out conſtantly; what an honour is it for a young man when his Bow abides in his ſtrength, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.24. for a man to ſuffer valiantly for the Truth, this is a ſign of ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Means to help a young man to this Spiritual ſtrength, and grow in it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Truth of grace; no man by any outward performance only can be ſtrong; a ſhadow of a man may be like a man, but it hath no ſtrength; truth of grace and power go together, but where there is no truth there is no power, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. therefore as we would be powerful in godlineſſe, let us do duties with hearty affection, do all things in obedience to God, and to do him ſervice, and this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth and ſincerity will grow up to ſuch ſtrength, as you may go further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and to conquer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To get ſtrength, we muſt get wholſome and good diet, and feed hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily on it; ſo if we would get Spiritual ſtrength, we muſt feed on the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, the Word of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. no man that receives the Word and Sacrament with a good heart, but he grows ſtrong thereby, they are meat and drink indeed, and it is not enough to hear, but eſpecially at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, and apply that which belongs to you; this is a means whereby you may grow ſtrong, and put forth your ſtrength to it: water it with Prayer, and look up to God for a Bleſſing: thus if a young man feed on theſe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meats he will grow ſtrong; indeed if a man feed on windy meats he will never grow ſtrong: ſo if men affect tricks of Elegancy, and Wit, and Speech, ſuch will be fill'd only with vain empty Notions, but he that feeds on wholſome food, on the purity and ſimplicity of Gods own Ordinances, will grow in ſtrength.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Exerciſe encreaſeth ſtrength: let a man daily exerciſe himſelf, let a man excerciſe himſelf in Grace, and he will grow up in the Lord, and increaſe in Spiritual ſtrength, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6, 7. a tree, the more deeply it is rooted, the more fruit it brings forth, and ſo they that walk daily in a Chriſtian courſe increaſe in ſtrength: it is not every duty that will ſtrengthen us, though it be often renewed, but walk in Chriſt, that is, walk not in your own ſtrength, in your own gifts and parts, <hi>Without me you can do nothing:</hi> even <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf was not able to think a good thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. therefore let us exerciſe our gifts in Chriſt, that is, to wait on Chriſt daily for the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of ſtrength, according to our daily employments, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.30.31. ſhall change his ſtrength, renew it according to the neceſſity of his buſineſſe, that ſo he may walk in obedience to him, and depend on him for ſtrength, and aim at his glory.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Becauſe we often contract Crudities, and ill Humours, therefore if wee would increaſe ſtrength wee muſt purge out theſe, ſo if we would get Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtrength; we muſt purge out our corruptions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5. there is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65998:60"/>
need of daily repentance which may caſt out all noyſome luſts and weakneſſes, and make us able to perform duties in ſtrength; as you deſire therefore to be ſtrong, and to have your ſtrength acknowledged by God, and good men; as you deſire to do the will of God chearfully, diligently, laboriouſly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly; as you deſire to ſuffer with boldneſſe and patience; as you deſire to ſtand out againſt all temptations, this God requires of you, to grow true heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to feed heartily on every ordinance, to exerciſe your graces in Chriſt, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him, to deny your ſelves; and if you find you have committed any ſin, caſt out all before God by confeſſion, and purge it out by repentance, and then you ſhall find your ſelves to increaſe in ſtrength, as becomes young-men.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 Satan fil'd his heart, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.2.27. and God gave a fit opportunity to take him; ſo the Phariſees they envied him, they ſaw he would take away their glory and credit, therefore they envied him, but thoſe were but ſuch occaſions as they might have reſiſted, he laid them by them, but rhey needed not have taken them up, he tryed them by it, but he did not tempt them to doe it.

                     <p n="1">1. When a man hath a longing deſire to thoſe things which are hurtfull unto him, as if by the Phyſician Wine be forbidden, or ſalt meats to ſome bodies, yet there is a luſt in mens natures to affect theſe; it was a luſt of intemperancy in the old Law, to deſire after any unclean meats forbidden, <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.4. they luſted after Swines fleſh, and abominable things, ſo that though a man exceed not in the meaſure, yet in the object, this is intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſuch a luſt was that in our firſt Parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. here was luſting after a meat forbidden, becauſe ſhe ſaw it was faire.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This luſt ſhews it ſelfe, not ſo much in the nature of the meats or drinks, as in the the meaſure of it, for a man may exceed meaſure in eating and drinking.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Beyond health, when it is not for ſtrength, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.16, 17. it is a luſt forbid to eat in the morning exceſſively, and glut themſelves, this is beyond the ſtrength of the body; the ſame may be ſaid of drinks in exceſſive manner, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. when the Lungs and Liver are diſtempered and inflamed, and health hurt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. this is an exceſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 When we covet meats and drinks beyond the meaſure of our eſtate, when we luſt above our means, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20, 21. when by coſtly meat and drink he weakens his eſtate, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.17. if a man be given to coſtly fare he ſhall ſurely come to poverty.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 A man may exceed, when he exceeds the meaſure of due order, when they compell men to eat and drink more than willingly they would.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 When we exceed the bounds of reaſon, when we ſo eat and drink that we forget our buſineſſe, and reaſon is quite diſturbed, as <hi>Lot</hi> was ſo drunk that he defiled his Daughters, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.33, 35. and <hi>Noah</hi> was ſo far drunk that he could not cover his nakedneſſe; in <hi>Lot,</hi> his reaſon was wholly taken away, in <hi>Noah</hi> partly; and now whether reaſon be diſturbed in part, or in whole, it is a luſt of the fleſh.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 He may exceed the bounds of his Calling; when he eats or drinks ſo much as makes him unfit for his Calling, this is a luſt of the fleſh that hinders either our generall or particular Calling, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. and for particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>They ate and dranke, and roſe up to play;</hi> ſo that the meat and drink that ſhould ſtrengthen a man, utterly diſables him to follow his Calling.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If we be carried to meat and drink with no other end but to eat, and drink, and ſatisfie our appetite, this is a luſt of the fleſh, a ſatisfying of the fleſh, and looking no further than to ſerve the body, this is oft the failing of many that abhor Gluttony and Drunkenneſſe, yet ask them why they eat and drink, it is onely to ſatisfie their appetite, this is onely to fulfill the luſts of the fleſh, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drinke, doe all to the glory of God;</hi> therefore not onely to pleaſe Nature, but to make you fit for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, either in your generall or particular callings. Let this be the laſt end of all your meat and drink, to glorifie God, to make you more chearfull and ſtrong about the buſineſſe God calls you to, not that it is a ſin to ſatisfie the appetite, for God hath not made the appetite fruſtrate, and it is of God to be hungry and thirſty, and we may chear our bodies, but we muſt not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate all this in eating and drinking, for then it is a luſt of the fleſh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.3, 4. <hi>Go and take thy Bow, and take ſome Veniſon, and make me ſavoury meat, ſuch as my ſoul loveth,</hi> What, did he onely look to pleaſe his appetite? no, but <hi>that I may eat and bleſſe thee,</hi> that being refreſhed by thy proviſion, I may be

ſtrengthned to bleſſe thee, a lively Pattern for all Chriſtians ſo to eat ſavoury meat, as that we may be fitted for prophecy if God call, fit to pray if God call, fit to hear, fit for any duty God ſhall call us to, and not to make us more dull and heavy.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee intemperance is a luſt of the fleſh, and wherein it conſiſts.</p>
                     <p>Next to that follows incontinency, which is an affection to women, which is inordinate, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.28. and that is a luſt to be avoided of all; And this luſt expreſſes it ſelfe in three kinds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 When it is carried to a wrong object, 2 When it exceeds meaſure, 3 When it aimes not at a right end.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, Sometimes the heart is carried to beaſtly unnaturall luſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature and order, as with beaſts, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. ſecondly, If it be carried to kindred, as when <hi>Ammon</hi> defiled his Siſter <hi>Tamer;</hi> and this luſt lies in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelfe to a wrong object; thirdly, When it is carried in women to men, or men to women before conſent of Parents, though it may be a fit match, yet it muſt be with conſent of Parents, though the Angell proſpered <hi>Abrahams</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in his way, yet he durſt not ask <hi>Rebeccahs</hi> good-will before he asked the good-will of her Parents.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It is a luſtfull affection in conjugall affection, when it exceeds meaſure, as when for it he omits his duty to God, or denies his profeſſion; ſometimes a man hath a good affection to Religion, but the love of his wife carries him away, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. a man may be ſo tranſported to his wife, that he dare not be forward in Religion, leſt he diſpleaſe his wife; and ſo the wife, leaſt ſhe diſpleaſe her husband: and this is an inordinate love, when it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds meaſure.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It is a luſt of the fleſh, when they are ſo tranſported with affection, that they look at no higher end than marriage it ſelfe, to have conjugall affection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. the meaning is, let ſuch as have wives look at them not for their own ends, but to be better fitted for Gods ſervice, and bring them nearer to God, and then we ſo have wives, as if we had them not; every man is to look at his wife, as a Talent ſent from God; and therefore he muſt look to reſtore it better by twofold at leaſt, that I may ſay, Lord here is the wife thou gaveſt me, and I am the more wiſe, and humble, and gracious; and ſo Children and Servants, when we affect them onely to doe our buſineſſe, and look at no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end but our ſelves, this is a luſt of the fleſh, when in any thing we enjoy, we look no higher but to pleaſe our ſelves therein.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 There is a luſt of the fleſh, which is a luſt of paſtime or pleaſure inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and this God threatens with poverty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.17.</p>
                     <p>There is a threefold luſt in paſtime, 1 When we are ſet on unlawful Objects, unlawful Games, 2 In exceſſive Manner, 3 To a wrong end.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Our paſtimes are unlawfull in reſpect of the Object, if we make a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime of every thing, of ſuch things as ſhould be matters of devotion, and ſorrow, and humiliation, we may not jeſt in Scripture phraſe, neither may we make ſhews and pageants of Scripture ſtories, as of Chriſt, or other holy men, this is unlawfull, to make paſtime of holy things; when <hi>Moſes</hi> drew near to God, and God called to him, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob,</hi> Exod. 3.5. <hi>God bid him put of his ſhooes, for the place whereon thou ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt is holy ground;</hi> when men come into the preſence of God, you ſhould put off your ſhooes, that is, your unclean affections; if we come near to God, we muſt not come with common ordinary affections, we muſt not come with our old ſhooes; ſo cards and dice, we may not make a paſtime of them, if they be lots, it is an ordinance of God, and therefore not to be made a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime of.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>There are ſome religious lots, ſome civill, ſome indifferent, if we ſhould deal with divine lots, we ſhould uſe more devotion, but the other a man may take more liberty in.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſay all lots are religious, whether they be about holy things, as
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65998:70"/>
chooſing Apoſtles; or civill, as caſting lots about diviſion of lands, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to determine a controverſy, or the like, as they caſt lots on Chriſts Garments; for it is not the object that makes a thing lawfull or unlawfull, as whether we ſwear in Religious or Civill matters, or Luſory; becauſe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we ſwear about, we call God to be a witneſſe; ſo in all kinde of lottery, whatſever it be about, we appeal to God, who is diſpoſer of all things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.33. for man being but <hi>cauſa per accidens</hi> of the event of the lot, there muſt be ſome cauſe <hi>per ſe,</hi> and that is God; ſo that whatſoever it be about, though matters of paſtime or luſory, it is a religious ordinance, becauſe it appeals to divine providence, and therefore to be avoided.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It is a wrong object, when we ſet our paſtime on other mens ſins, which ſhould be matter of griefe and ſorrow, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. it was prophaneneſſe in <hi>Cham</hi> to make a mock at his Fathers nakedneſſe, ſo it is prophaneſſe to make others drunk, and then make a paſtime of it, and ſo for ſtage-playes, to put on womens apparrell, to make paſtime; ſo to make paſtime by them, who live without a calling.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 When men play with the Judgements of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.120. if you ſee Gods Judgements on another, make not a paſtime of other mens infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in this regard it hath been thought unmeet for great men to keep fools and mad-men to make them paſtime, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.14, 15. he thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet for the gravity of a King, to make paſtime of his folly, not but that a man may ſmile at the ſimplicity of an Ideot, but yet he ſhould ſee Gods hand in it, and be thankfull to God that he is not ſuch a one; ſo it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to make a mear recreation of hawking and hunting, ſeeing the enmity between the Creatures came for our ſins, and therefore it ſhould be a matter of compaſſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Paſtime is unlawfull when it exceeds meaſure. 1 Of time, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.16. when men ſpend whole nights and dayes in paſtime.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 When men make an occupation of recreation, as ſtage-players, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, men ſhould have a calling beſides; ſo then it is prophaneſſe for a man, altogether to follow his paſtime and recreation, according to the Proverb, What hath a Gentlemen but his pleaſure? ſix dayes ſhould be imployed in the works of our callings.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 When we abuſe it in exceſſe of our affections, that our hearts are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed therewith.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 When we look at a wrong end, when as in our paſtime, we look at no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er end than our own pleaſure, whereas <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do it for the glory of God;</hi> we ſhould hereby be the better fitted for Gods ſervice.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, When we abuſe our paſtime in regard of gain, though carding were lawfull, yet to make a gain of it, <hi>Aristotle</hi> could reprove it as <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, for paſtime ſhould be for our delight, and not to make a gain of; it is not a vendible matter to pay for our paſtime, that a man ſhould ſell his paſtime, is filthy lucre; indeed if you play for no more than you would ſpend betwixt you, or give to the poor, it is not unwarrantable, but to make a gain of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, is an abuſe of the paſtime.</p>
                     <p>The laſt luſt of the fleſh, is the luſt of Idleneſſe, or eaſe, or ſleepineſſe, for it is the body that craves ſleep and eaſe, and is ſatisfied with it; ſleep begets drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and caſe begets Idleneſſe; now theſe, both young and old are to be weaned from.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 In holy duties, when we are ſo drowzy that we cannot attend to them, the very inclination to ſleep is now a ſinfull luſt; this luſt fell heavily on <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiches, Acts</hi> 20.29. an heavy ſleep fell on him, and an heavy hand of God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, which ſhewed his judgement, though he reſtored him, becauſe he

                     <p>In Gods ordinances we complain of ſluggiſhneſſe, but is not the fault in our ſelves? better fares a ſluggiſh ſoul with an handfull with eaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo a ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh man roſteth not that which he catcheth in hunting, it hath no warmth, no ſpirit in it; our bodies and ſouls ſhould be as a burnt ſacrifice, therefore muſt not be cold; and to this end, he exhorts us not to be ſluggiſh in buſineſſe, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.7. whatſoever thou doeſt, doe it with all thy might; therefore when we have any work to doe that requires diligence, yea though it were to ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the enemy, as he underſtands it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.10. <hi>Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully, that keeps back his ſword from blood.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2 It is a luſt of the fleſh, when a man is carried to ſleep above due meaſure, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.9, 10, 11. poverty comes on ſuch a one ſuddenly and ſtrongly, moſt mens natures require ſeven hours ſleep, ſome eight, and that is the moſt; and if we obſerve it; we ſhall finde the ſame diſtempers ariſe from too much ſleep, that ariſe from want of ſleep, it makes the body drowzy, and the brain dull, and makes a man unfit for any thing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 This love of Sleep and Reſt is a luſt of the fleſh, when we uſe it not to a right end; now the end of all Sleep and Reſt, is to refreſh the Spirit and ſtrengthen the body, and help digeſtion, like the unbending of a Bow to make it ſtronger, if a Bow ſtand always bent it weakens it; therefore ſo much Sleep as may help digeſtion and comfort and refreſh a mans body and ſpirit, God allows; God knows all the Comforts of this life are little enough to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold us againſt vexations and diſcouragements, but when a man is grown to love Sleep and Eaſe, a little more Sleep, a little more Slumber, one eaſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, and never looks how to imploy it to Gods ſervice, now he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds no right end, but we eaſe our ſelves that we may be eaſed, and never look further than Eaſe and Sleep, and ſo we reſt in the Creature, and never look up to God, to whom all our Eaſe and refreſhment ſhould tend, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe its a Luſt of the Fleſh, becauſe we look no further, but to ſatisfie the Fleſh, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.14.

is never off the Hinges; ſo a ſluggard would toſſe himſelf from one ſide to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; the door hath ſome end in turning upon the Hinges, to open and ſhut, but a Sluggard doth no good by it, but rowls himſelf from one ſide to another, after he is ſatisfied with Sleep, but cannot get up, and then when he is up, hee doth nothing but rowl himſelf from one thing to another, hee hath no ſetled buſineſſe to imploy himſelf about, but takes care what to do, he goes from one Company to another, from one Game to another, till he ſhuts out the day, and then he returns to his Reſt and Eaſe and ſleep again, as it was with <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John, Mat.</hi> 26.41. when Chriſt called on them to watch and pray, he comes and finds them ſleeping, what ſaith he, the ſpirit indeed is willing, but the fleſh is weak; even then when he had moſt need, and themſelves alſo, of watchfullneſſe, they fell into drowſineſſe, and ſo fell into Temptation, that they all left Chriſt, and <hi>Peter</hi> eſpecially; <hi>Simon</hi> ſleepeſt thou, whom Sathan deſires to winnow? For thee now to Sleep is a Luſt of the Fleſh. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo look at Sleep and Eaſe as that we muſt give account of; Its a common fault of Gentlemen that live of their own Means, they may Live at Eaſe and reſt they think, what is a Gentleman but his Eaſe and Pleaſure, God forbid that we ſhould be like that Fool in the Goſpel, <hi>Soul take thine Eaſe, thou haſt Goods laid up for many years,</hi> you muſt not think that God hath given great means and eſtate to live at eaſe, the glorious Angells are miniſtring Spirits, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duties with all agility and chearfullneſſe; <hi>Adam</hi> who was Lord of the world, yet was ſet to till the ground, from the higheſt creature to the loweſt, all have employments appointed them by God.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 It will bring you to poverty, that you ſhall be ſuddenly Beggars, and that without remedy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It diſtempers your Bodies and Stomachs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It will make your Souls naked and ragged; that is plain, the field of the ſluggard is over-grown with Thorns and Thiſtles, all your impatience, vanity, idleneſſe, all your dullneſſe, unprofitableneſſe in your life, it ſprings from your ſluggiſhneſſe of heart, you have not ſtirred up your ſpirits.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 It will make you a Brother to a great waſter, you waſte your outward patrimony, and your patrimony of Grace; when <hi>Peter</hi> was once fallen into drowſineſſe, how wofully was he bankrout, how poor and naked? <hi>Simon</hi> ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt thou? and we ſee Temptation came on him ſuddenly, and ſtrongly.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Such as do their buſineſſe with a ſlack unbent hand, curſed be that man; if you ſee a ſluggiſh hand, God leaves him to himſelf, he curſes both himſelfe and his buſineſſe; therefore be diligent and fruitful and ſtrengthen your ſelves, you ſhall finde the bleſſing of God going along with you, proſpering your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Souls.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee what are the Luſts of the fleſh; they are ſuch as the body af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and is ſatisfied with, as intemperancy, incontinency, love of paſtime, and love of idleneſſe and ſleep, theſe are the luſts of the fleſh.</p>

why take this courſe againſt a Luſt, do but once give way to any Luſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſatisfying it, you will adde fuell to it, this will be a way to ingage you to a further commiſſion of that luſt; many have a conceit, may I but now tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with a cuſtomer and get a good bargain I will give it over; why, give but once way to a luſt, and it will make ſuch a gap, that all the luſts in the Forreſt may break in, make but one little creviſe in the bank of the Sea, thinking to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the rage of the Sea; why it will make it wider and overflow all, ſo if you give but a little way to a luſt, to a little Gluttony, or Intemperancy, you will never give over, <hi>modo &amp; modo, non habent modum,</hi> the more fuel you give, the ſtronger the fire of luſt burns.</p>

Secondly, Uſe ſome courſe to ſtupifie that part. Thirdly, Cut it off; would you mortifie luſt? Beware of all occaſions, if ſuch meats or drinks wilt make you Gluttons or Drunkards, meddle not with them, and ſo you ſhall hinder influence to theſe luſts: apply the death of Chriſt, the threatnings of God, and ſo when it begins to ſtupifie, cut it off; better it is to want all the ſinful pleaſures of this life, than having of them to be caſt into Hell.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 This luſt of the Eye is expreſſed in exceſſive meaſure, and this is called a greedy eye, a man perhaps will not get it but by honeſty, but when he hath laid hold on goods he is never ſatisfied, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.8. ſo <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.9, 10, 11. like a Dropſie, the more a man drinks the more he deſires; ſo, the more a man hath, the more he deſires, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.20. there a greedy eye, or covetous heart is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Hell and the Grave, you may as ſoon ſatisfie Hell as a covetous heart, you may ſooner fill his Land, or Houſes, or Barns, than fill his eye, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>This greedy eye offends againſt that inward contentment that a man owes to his Soul, when he is ſo covetous that his heart is never ſatisfied.</p>

                     <p>Pride of Life is an inordiate affection of our hearts unto Carnal excellency, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be great in our ſelves, and for our ſelves; a proud man contends with God about the cauſe and end of his life, he will depend on himſelf, and makes himſelf the end.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 As he depends on himſelf, makes himſelf the cauſe of all, ſo it is ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 As he affects and aims at excellency in himſelf, ſo it is called Self-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                     <p>When he depends on himſelf, he throws off the Crown from Gods head, there are four parts of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Self-conceit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. when a man thinks ſoberly of himſelf, he is not ſo blinde as not to ſee himſelf, nor ſo proud, but he is willing not to think above that which is meet.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It is expreſt in Carnal confidence and preſumption, he doth what he doth by his own ſtrength, and wit, and pains, this is call'd Arrogancy; when a man undertakes to carry through buſineſſe by his own ſtrength, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.7. to 11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.12, 13. he boaſts of his Wiſdom and Power to do great matters.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Curioſity flows from Self-dependance, when a man will thruſt himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that he ought not; ſo it was vain curioſity in <hi>Eve</hi> to affect Knowledge, ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Paul</hi> reproves the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> for prying into ſecrets.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 It is expreſt in Self-fulneſſe, he is full of himſelf, and reſts himſelf in his preſent condition, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. and thanks God it is well with him, and he deſires to be no better, all theſe are ſeveral luſts of pride.</p>
                     <p>This ſin is againſt God, as one, from whom, to whom, and in whom are all things.</p>
                     <p>A Second Branch of this pride of life is Self-ſeeking, <hi>He ſeeks not God in all his waies,</hi> Pſal. 10.3, 4. ſo he ſeeks not Gods glory, but his own, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.27. It is not good to eat much Hony, ſo for men to ſeek their own glory, is not glory; as much Honey turns into choller, and bitterneſſe, ſo he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ks up too much of his own glory, but it turns to his ſhame and confuſion.</p>
                     <p>This Self-ſeeking ſhew it ſelf;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In purſuing of his own glory, he looks no further than his own glory, which is ſhewed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In Ambition, when they aim at their glory, and primary, this St. <hi>John</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> 3 Epiſt. 9. ſo <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. this was ambition in affecting a Government God did not appoint them, the modeſter ſort of Trees did think they ſhould loſe their fatneſſe, and ſweetneſſe, as if he ſhould ſay, for them to be ambitious of an unappointed Government, it would turn to bitterneſſe, and harſhneſſe, and loſſe of fatneſſe, and comfort, and this comes all ambition to, it makes the ſoul lean, and loſe all comfort from God and man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Hypocriſie is another luſt of pride in Self-ſeeking, when a man in religious duties ſeeks his own credit and applauſe, to be ſeen of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.5. this is pride in Hypocriſie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.1, 2. to 16. hence comes ſelf rejoycing, when he rejoyceth in his own praiſe and glory, as <hi>Amos</hi> 6.14. ſo <hi>Herod</hi> rejoyced in the applauſe of the people, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 There is another luſt of Self-ſeeking, which is, contemning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65998:74"/>
others in reſpect of a mans own excellency, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from making himſelf his own end.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 There is another luſt of pride which is expreſt in boaſting of himſelf, either in words, or carriage, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.2. that is boaſting, when a man magnifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, boaſting in words, in great and falſe promiſes, ſo in geſture in the eyes. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. <hi>Prov</hi> 30.13. ſo in ſtretched-out necks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.23. when a man ſtruts, and prides himſelf in his carriage.</p>
                     <p>So there is pride in Work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, when men build to make themſelves a name, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. ſo in ſtrange faſhions and apparrel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.18. to 24. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they took pride in their bravery and gay cloaths, therefore he would ſend baldneſſe inſtead of beauty, &amp;c. ſo pride is ſhewed in Feaſting, to ſhew their own Magnificence and Riches, and they aim only at that, as <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. when he feaſted as a King.</p>
                     <p>There is another pride expreſt, when a man is croſt in his pride, and this ſhews it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In diſcontent, when a man hath made himſelf his end, and if he be croſt in it, he is diſcontented, as <hi>Achitophel</hi> when his counſel was croſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. he was ſo diſcontented at it that he went and hanged himſelf: and ſo ſome, though they do not grow ſo deſperate, yet they ſo vex and fret, as that they can neither eat, nor ſleep ſeaſonably, whereas if we made God our end, we ſhould be willing to want what God denies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Hee falls into contention, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.13. all contention comes from pride.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Indignation flows from being croſt, when others take away their applauſe, they diſdain and loathe it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.15. as the Phariſees did, when they ſaw Chriſt took away their praiſe.</p>

                     <p>Means to wean us from Pride.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Meditate on what you are, do but know your ſelves what you are, what you muſt tend to, Duſt you are, and to duſt you muſt return, you have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance but on God: ſhall we then be full of our ſelves? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. God made all for himſelf, therefore we are not to aime at our ſelves, eſpecially conſider there is nothing but you have deſpiſed and perverted, therefore conſider your own inſufficiency.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Exerciſe your ſelves in thoſe graces that are moſt contrary to Pride, if you ſee your hearts grow ambitious, and vain-glorious, and diſcontent, why weed out this luſt, renew your repentance in duſt any aſhes, loathe your ſelves, judge your own unworthineſſe, learn to live by faith, know you are nothing of your ſelves, but depend wholly on Chriſt, learn to be obedient, to be at Gods Command, we are ſervants, and therefore not for our ſelves: it is not

out that theſe were the very laſt dayes, when there have been ſo many chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſince, the ten perſecutions, the flouriſhing of the church under <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and after it, a great miſt of Ignorance, and ſince the light of the Goſpel; how then did he call them the laſt times, ſince there have been ſo many changes ſince?</p>
                     <p>There is a double reaſon of this, in regard of the Apoſtles ſence and ſcope that they aimed at, for they did not mean that the laſt judgment ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently come, for whereas ſome Chriſtians began to grow ſlack in their callings, becauſe they thought it would be in vain, the laſt judgement being ſo near, he ſeriouſly diſwades them from ſuch ſuddain expectation of it, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. ſo that though he had ſaid that day is at hand, yet he would not have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that it ſhould preſently come upon them, for firſt, there muſt be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy; therefore we ſee they were not deceived, or ſpake uncertainly.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Therefore they are called the laſt times, becauſe they are the laſt period of time, before the laſt Judgment.</p>
                     <p>The firſt period was from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> 2450 years, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4. the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond period of time was from <hi>Moſet</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.13. for in the firſt age the Church was not national, nor any writings of the word, only they delivered the law and promiſes from Family to Family; many years after <hi>Moſes</hi> time, he collected a Nationall Church of the Jews, and excluded the nations by a partition wall of cetemonies which the Gentiles would not conform to, then did he give them the Law written, and this continued till Chriſts time.</p>
                     <p>The third Period of time, or third age, is from Chriſts time to the end of the World, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. <hi>in theſe laſt dayes, &amp;c.</hi> It is the laſt time of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Gods Will, and we muſt expect no further Revelation to the end; for though the Church hath ſeen many differences, yet there is but one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Doctrin, that God hath ſet up for all that will be ſaved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16, 17. now whilſt Chriſt lived, that is before he was crucified, he might change the forme of the Teſtament, but now there is no more opportunity of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he hath delivered his laſt will, which ſhall not be reverſed, if now there comes any and declares a new Doctrine, let him be accurſed, he is an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Apoſtle had ſome reſpect to their particular Eſtate, ſtirring them up to many duties on this ground, becauſe the end drew near, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. and this would not be an argument of patience, unleſſe be had ſome reſpect of their particular, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>In what ſence ſhall we underſtand that the coming of Chriſt was near in the Apoſtles times?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 In oppoſition to former ages which were far off.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>In Gods account a thouſand years are but as one day,</hi> 2 Pet, 3.8, 9. yet God will come ſo, that when the day of accompliſhment is come, he will not ſtay a day longer, for that were as much to him as a thouſand years.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Such is the Faith of many chriſtians, that what they ſee in a promiſe, it is as much as if it were preſently fulfilled, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.36.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> In eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, we ſhall find that St. <hi>John</hi> lived about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after Chriſt, and was born about the ſame time with Chriſt, now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 26 after Chriſt, Hiſtories report there was <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who ſeemed to be the great power of God, and to be he that gave the Law in Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 He gave out that it was he that was crucified under <hi>Tiberius Ceſar,</hi> here was an Antichriſtian ſpirit, and I was, ſaith he, that Holy Ghoſt, that deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Apoſtles, ſo that he denyed both the Father and the Son: after him ſprang up <hi>Menander,</hi> that affirmed that it was he that died for the World, and that all that believed on him ſhould be ſaved. In thoſe times <hi>Ebion</hi> taught that Chriſt was but a meer man, and held circumciſion neceſſary, and in his time li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> who retained all the Judicall Law, and denyed Chriſt to be God, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1. and he is held to be one of thoſe that held the World to be made by Angells, and he was the root of the error of the Chiliaſts, all theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in <hi>Johns</hi> time.</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1 It ſhews us the marvelous enmity of that wicked one, that as ſoon as ever Chriſt had ſowed good ſeed, that evil one ſowed tares, this was the ſubtilty of that old Serpent to ſow errors, before the truth could take firm rooting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Hence we ſee the impudency of Hereſie, eſpecially, when oppoſition is ſet on fire of Hell, that ſuch monſtrous opinions ſhould be broached in St. <hi>Johns</hi> time that envied againſt them, and wrote againſt them; and therefore we muſt not wonder if Hereſies <hi>ſine pudore,</hi> broach themſelves in the Church, for even in St. <hi>Johns</hi> time a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Hence wee ſee the truth of God, is of more power than the ſpirit of Error, for though there were ſo many heads of Error, yet they all fell down before the Doctrine of St. <hi>John,</hi> ſo that this writing remained, when all they were loſt, <hi>magna eſt veritas &amp; prevalebit,</hi> therefore ſuch is the power of truth, that it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells all Errors.</p>

At this time Antichriſt began to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the full, for though after that time ſome godly men were in that Seat, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, and ſome others, yet the queſtion is not of the Perſon, but of the place.</p>

                     <p>A. Though the Antichriſt was not then revealed, yet the Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity did then work in many men, when St. <hi>John</hi> wrote this Epiſtle; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> his ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> for then men began to obſerve the Traditions of men, and the Laws of the Church muſt be as well kept as Gods Laws, againſt whom St. <hi>John</hi> wrote in his ſecond Epiſtle, verſ. 5, 6, 7. beſides, ſome then exalted themſelves above their Brethren, as you may ſee in his third Epiſtle, and ſo did put out their Brethren; this was the Spirit which made way for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> exalting himſelf above other Biſhops, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was above Kings and Princes: this Myſtery by degrees encreaſed, now as the King may be ſaid to come when he is yet in his Chamber, but ſome Parliament men go before, and the King follows ſoon after; ſo it is here, becauſe Antichriſt was not to come nakedly, but with Pomp, therefore way was made, and the Apoſtle wrote againſt the ſpirit of Antichriſt then working, though Antichriſt himſelf was not ſo fully revealed till afterwards, and ſo it is plain that which was ſpoken of Antichriſt is in ſome part full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. A ſeperation Local, ſuch was that practiſe of the Tribe of <hi>Gad.</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes.</hi> Joſh. 22.9, 10. it was not ſeperation in fellowſhip as they profeſſe, verſ. 26, 27, but that is not a ſeperation that makes an Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 A departing in fellowſhip, which yet falls ſhort of an Antichriſtian ſpirit, though it deſerve blame and reproof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12. not but that his judgement and affection was with them, yet he with-drew from their ſociety in Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for this <hi>Paul</hi> blamed him, but yet it was not an Antichriſtian ſpirit, though he were a man of great zeale and courage, yet none ſo ſubject to be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with fear as he was, let chriſtians therefore moſt ſuſpect themſelves there wherein they leaſt ſuſpect themſelves, and think themſelves ſtrongeſt, but this was an infirmity in him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 There is a departing from the Faith of the church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſitting looſe from them in Spirit, judgement, and affection, their Doctrin contrary, and hearts contrary, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the latter dayes certain ſhall depart from the Faith,</hi> Heb. 10.25. to 29. ſo that ſuch fall off not only in place, or fellowſhip, in ordinance, but in judgment, heart, and affection, that is a mark of an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſpirit, <hi>Jude</hi> 4.5. 3 Epiſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8, 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid of the new converts that were added to the church, that <hi>they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Apoſtles Doctrin and fellowſhip,</hi> Acts 2.42. therefore when they break from the fellowſhip of the church, they depart from the Apoſtles doctrin.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. From the fellowſhip the true Members of the church have with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.4. therefore when you ſee a ſpirit of with-drawing from the fellowſhip of the church, they depart from the Apoſtles Doctrine, and if from them, then from Chriſt, for ſurely our fellowſhip is with God, and with the Son, therefore to prevent that denying of Chriſt, he gives them charge that they doe not forſake aſſembling themſelves, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. to 29. A finger cut off from the hand, is not only cut off from the hand but from the head too; ſo if men fall off from the Members, they will alſo fall off from Chriſt the Head.</p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Seems to inform our judgements what to think in caſe of ſeperation, for this place is much abuſed; The Papiſts they build on this place that they that ſeperate from their church are Antichriſts. That company, ſay they that breake off from the fellowſhip of the church is Antichriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is plain here; now what were <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> but ſuch as brake off from the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the church, therefore they were of Antichriſts ſpirit, and fore-runners of him.</p>
                     <p>We muſt therefore know, it is not every ſeperation from that which is called a church that is a note of an Antichriſtian ſpirit, but it muſt be known whether that were the true church; now this church St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65998:85"/>
was the true Church, for it was from ſuch whoſe ſins were forgiven; now if it be not a true Church that they breake from, it is no ſign of Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 11.16. ſuch as ſet their hearts to ſeek the Lord, ſeperated themſelves from thoſe that followed <hi>Jereboam,</hi> and came to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo the Apoſtles were faine to ſeperate from the Church of the <hi>Jewes</hi> which perſecuted Chriſt, and them, and ſo conſtituted a Church by themſelves, a Chriſtian Church; ſo then it is not a ſeperation from a falſe Church, but a true, that is a ſign of an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian ſpirit.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But what pretence, or juſt ground had ſuch Divines to fall from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church, or we in</hi> England? <hi>for we, only upon the falling out of</hi> Hen. 8. <hi>with the Pope fell from him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> True, that matter of Divorce did move him to fail off from the Pope, and indeed, that cauſe was enough to fall off from the Pope, who would binde a Prince to an unlawful Marriage.</p>
                     <p>But the whole body of Chriſtendom had a Three-fold ground of ſeperation which may be juſt, when a Church is heretical; that is, hold an errour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the foundation obſtinately, yet that is not a ſufficient ground; as the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> denied the Reſurrection from the Dead, yet he calls them Saints; ſo though the Phariſees had charged that none ſhould profeſs Chriſt, which was an obſtinate denying of Chriſt, and taught falſe Doctrine, yet Chriſt charges them to obey them becauſe they ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, and therefore fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental erroneouſneſſe is not alwayes a juſt cauſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Therefore that is a juſt cauſe of ſeperation, when a Church is infected with Blaſphemy, and Contradiction, and Blaſpheme the wayes of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.45, 46.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Idolatry is a juſt ground of ſeperation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Perſecution is a juſt ground of ſeperation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1.</p>
                     <p>Now all theſe have met in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they have blaſphemed and condemned as Heretical, Juſtification by Faith, and other fundamentall truths.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 They worſhip Images, as of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> yea with Divine honour, as the Bread in the Sacrament, what greater Idolatry?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The World knows, and the blood of thouſands of Martyrs can teſtifie their horrible Perſecutions, that as long as we were ſubordinate to them, we could not profeſs the true Religion without loſs of Goods and life, therefore we have juſt cauſe to ſeperate our ſelves from them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>

                     <p>Surely their practiſe is blame-worthy.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Becauſe they ſeperate, where Chriſt keeps fellowſhip, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. and that he walks with us, we argue, becauſe he is ſtill pleaſed to diſpence to us the Word of Life, and edifies many ſouls thereby, and therefore ſurely Chriſt hath fellowſhip, and ſhall man be more pure than his Maker? where Chriſt vouch. ſafes fellowſhip, ſhall man renounce it?</p>
                     <p>If they be converted, where had they their converſion?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Have not many of Gods Servants heretofore kept company with Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as corrupt as ours are? Did not <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> keep company with them and ſhall they be more pure and curious?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Chriſt commands, <hi>If thy Brother offends admoniſh him,</hi> Matth. 18.17. <hi>if he hear thee not, take two or three more, if he hear not them, then tell it to the Church, and if he heare not the Church, let him be to thee as an Heathen, or Publican;</hi> but if the church hear not thy complaint, he doth not ſay let the church be as an Heathen, or Publican; now there are many of our Seperatiſts never admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed their Brethren, nor made their complaint to the church, and if they did, and the church heard them not, muſt they therefore Excommunicate the church, and renounce it? therefore unleſſe you find in it Blaſphemy, or Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, or Perſecution, there is no juſt ground of ſeperation.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 Becauſe a man may conſent to it, either as probable, or as certain and evident knowledge, therefore it is not only an underſtanding of the truth, but a conſenting to it, and that not as a probable thing, but as an undoubted certain truth, <hi>Judicium contingentis axiomatis eſt opinio, neceſſarii ſcientia,</hi> if it be from the cauſes, then it is <hi>ſcientia,</hi> if by the effects, <hi>cognitio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus theſe Babes know the truth, you underſtand it, you conſent to it,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65998:92"/>
you yeeld to it as a certain and undoubted truth; and that all thoſe concur to knowledge, we may ſee by Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 For underſtanding, ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 24.45.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 They approve and conſent to it, and follow it, <hi>John</hi> 10.4, 5, 27.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 He gives them experience, that their hearts do as plainly feel, as their underſtandings know; nay theſe Babes, they fetch their underſtanding from the feeling of their hearts, they know the danger of ſin, and the worth of Chriſt, and this puts them to reach after Chriſt, and look at him as the moſt excellent of a thouſand, and ſo they come to finde true fellowſhip with Chriſt, by puting into them a ſpirit of peace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. ſo that they know it not only by faith, but by experience, and ſo they know the truth as it is in Chriſt; you may have men by hearing and ſtudy, come to know very largely of the wayes of Grace; the Doctrins and points of Divinity; nay, they may come to approve of them, and may convince an adverſary, but yet this is not properly a knowledge of theſe things, but an underſtanding of them; a man that wants this Unction may ſay, he underſtands theſe, and beleeves them, but he cannot ſay he knowes them by any ſenſible worke of God on his own ſoul.</p>

It would be a great conflict to a faithful Miniſter to ſee people poor in knowledge, to have only a few remnants and ſhreds of knowledge, ſome ſuperficial kinde of knowledge, therefore let people labour for the riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding, which is properly true knowledge; we ſee therefore how much Parents and Maſters are to blame, that are ſo far from having conflicts for the knowledge of their Children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Servants, that they have no care at all to help them on; you are mercileſſe Parents, and Maſters, that do not labour to bring them on to the riches of knowledge, for without this they ſhall finde no mercy, nor favour from God.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Therefore liſten to private Chriſtians, but frequent the Ordinances, whereby you ſhall grow up to fulneſſe of knowledge.</p>
                     <p>The Second Means, is, frequency in prayer, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.13, 14.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obedience is the way to get knowledge, <hi>If any man do my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Will he ſhall know the truth;</hi> if you pray to God, and come to the Word, with a deſire to do what you hear, and reſolve that what the Lord ſpeaks, you will hear and do it, and not only ſuch reſolution as is extorted by ſome Thunder-ſhakings, as the Jews, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. but when you have a ſetled reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to obey what you know to be Gods Will, God will increaſe your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

that he ſhould keep ſome correſpondency with Chriſt, and his, and ſits as a Member of Chriſt, otherwiſe no Church would ſuffer him; ſo that he ſhould not openly and groſly deny Chriſt, but he ſhould deny him to be that Chriſt that is anoynted of God, anoynted to be King, Prieſt and Prophet; therefore if you ſhall finde any in the Church to deny Chriſt to be King, Prieſt and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of his Church, that is Antichriſt; therefore obſerve how their Doctrine cuts aſunder the whole work of Redemption.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 For his prophetical office, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> denies it; Chriſt is anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a Prophet to teach his Church by his Word, and by his Spirit in his Word; they deny his Propheticall Office.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 By making it not plentifull; whereas the Redemption of Chriſt is a plenteous redemption both for body and ſoule, they ſay he redeems us from eternall pains, but not from temporall, from Purgatory.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 They evacuate his Sacrifice, by making it not eternal; ſo that this grace is not certainly eternall, but he that hath been waſhed in Chriſts blood, may finally fall away, and become a reprobate.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 They evacuate his Prieſtly Office, by diſcouraging people from coming to God in the name of Chriſt, but to approach to God by the mediation of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſome Saints; they would have us direct our prayers to ſome Saint, and ſo deny the ſole mediation of Chriſt.</p>

In other places of Scripture, when the cleareſt promiſes of grace and perſeverance are laid down, there is exhortation to carefull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12, 13. though thou canſt not fall finally, yet <hi>let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13. not a carnal fear, but ſuch a fear as is oppoſed to carnal confidence and pride, though <hi>God work both the will and the deed; Paul</hi> a man moſt confident of his good eſtate, ſo as he trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed in his eſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi> Did this make him carnally ſecure?

now more vigilant and carefull than before, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26, 27. ſo we ſee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence breeds not negligence, but rather diligence: ſo we read he renounced all for Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9. yet ver. 12, 13. the more aſſurance he had, the more vigilant he was; and now little Children even now you have a promiſe to abide in Chriſt, abide in him.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Theſe Promiſes encreaſe love in us; the more beautifull God is in his Promiſes, the more doth the love of Chriſt conſtrain us.</p>

Many Afflictions, as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bolts lie on Gods children, many vexations, therefore they deſire the Lord to haſten his coming, to rid them out of all their miſery, and revenge them of their enemies.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. When they have looſly and negligently laid up the evidences of their eſtate, as a man at the Aſſizes, that is to try his Evidences, if he have them to ſeek, he deſires the Aſſizes were put off.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Sometimes he is fearfull, when he knows he had lived ſomewhat looſly, and his heart hath run a Whoring from God by ſome carnall delights, ſo that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65998:108"/>
he would gladly gather up himſelf better, before he go hence and be no more ſeen; becauſe our hearts have gone whoriſhly from God, we are affraid, not that he will caſt us off, but that we ſhall not find that welcome which otherwiſe we ſhould, if we had time to recover our ſelves. So <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 39. <hi>ult.</hi> he was in ſome grievous Diſeaſe, and ſomewhat conſcious his ſpirit was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but he had much weakned his grace, therefore he prayes, <hi>O ſpare me a little, that I may recover my ſelfe, before I go hence and be no more ſeen.</hi> Hence, oft Chriſtians at their converſion are afraid of Death and Judgement, becauſe their Evidences are not ſo good, and others afraid, becauſe they have blurred their Evidences by ſome ſinfull delight, and ſitting looſe from God, but yet their fear differs from wicked mens, wicked men tremble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no evidence at all, but a godly man knows he hath eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but he hath them not ſo ready, and therefore deſires to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>

It may ſtir us up all, as ever we deſire to live comfortably, and dye gloriouſly; ſo to have a care to abide in Chriſt, otherwiſe you will dye both with fear and ſhame; but if you abide in Chriſt, you may with boldneſſe look Death in the face, therefore abide not in your Naturall eſtate, Civil hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, but abide in Chriſt. It is a prophane and falſe ſpeech of ſome Politicians, that ſay, Religion makes men cowards, and never famous Warriors; no, doth that make us cowards that makes us look Death in the face, and Judgement alſo? were thoſe cowards that have lookt Fire and Faggot, and Torments in the face? therefore it is not Religion, but want of Religion, that makes men cowards; therefore ſtrengthen your Faith, and ſo you ſhall expect Chriſts co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with confidence, and boldneſſe, and courage.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> It doth not conſiſt in the underſtanding of it, conceiving it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging it; for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could ſay, <hi>The Lord is righteous,</hi> Exod. 9.27. and yet he could not come to ſay, that Gods people were righteous, and born of God, he did not ſee that God afflicted him for oppreſſing his people, this he was convinced of, that God was righteous, but yet he would not ſay, you <hi>Moſes</hi> and his people are born of God. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.47. certainly ſaith the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, this was a righteous man, and yet we doe not read that he joyned himſelfe to the Diſciples of Chriſt; but this Teſtimony was extorted by the wonderfull works of God.</p>
                     <p>To know therefore that Chriſt is righteous, is to acknowledge him by divine Faith; and they know, that he that doth Righteouſneſſe is born of God.</p>
                     <p>There are three things implyed in it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. No man knows Chriſt to be Righteous, but he that is ſenſible of his own unrighteouſneſſe, otherwiſe he cannot know that Chriſt is Righteous, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8. <hi>Paul</hi> before his calling, thought himſelfe Righteous, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, but when he ſaw that Chriſt was Righteous, he ſaw that himſelfe was unrighteous; therefore he thought all his own Righteouſneſſe loſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Chriſts, his education, his profeſſion, his wiſdome, his zeal, his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, he counted all loſſe to win Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It implies a ſenſible experience of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, pacifying our conſciences, and purging them from dead works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. for Chriſts Righteouſneſſe doth both; none know Chriſt to be Righteous, but they that know that in his Righteouſneſſe, they have their conſciences quieted and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, they are freed from the guilt and uncleanneſſe of an evill conſcience, they know that they are ſuch grievous ſinners, that if Chriſt were not Righteous, they could never look for pardon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. They finde the power of Chriſts Righteouſneſſe, purging their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from dead works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. all our works before were dead, but now by the blood of Chriſt we are purged from them, and quickned to doe him lively ſervice, though a man may have a good opinion that Chriſt was a good man, and may have a generall beliefe that he was ſo, and that he was both God and Man, yet none know it, but thoſe that know they have ſo woefully provoked, that if Chriſt their Mediator were not Righteous, they could have no hope of pardon or mortification, ſuch onely know it certainly by experience in their own ſoules, for <hi>Scientia eſt rerum certarum &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſariarum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>How doe ſuch know that they that work Righteouſneſſe are born of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. They know him by experience of their own ſpirits, they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they never wrought a work of Righteouſneſſe, till they were born of Chriſt; all their works before, were for the World, or for ſelf-love; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they find a man denying himſelfe, not looking at his own ends, going out of himſelfe, not relying upon himſelfe, nor aiming at his own ends; they know ſuch are born of God, or elſe they could not doe ſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10.12. not one naturall man comes off with a good work.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They know it from the life of Chriſt that breaths and works in every work of Righteouſneſſe, and the works of it, they know their own ſpirits would not reach it.</p>
                     <p>Two things make our converſion to be called a new birth, for in it ſelfe it is but onely an alteration, not in ſubſtance, but in qualities, which is properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alteration, but it is called a new birth, or regeneration.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe it changes the whole man: as in generation, there is a whole change from one thing to another; ſo in regeneration, there is an alteration of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65998:110"/>
the whole old man, into the whole new man, a new heart, new judgement, new affections.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is the mighty power of God, as in generation, there is more in it than any work of Parents, it could not be without a ſpeciall concurrennce of Gods mighty power: ſo in converſion, there muſt not onely be a change of ſome qualities, but a mighty power in changing us wholly, from our old Eſtate to a new.</p>

We were Harlots, running a whoring after our pleaſures and profit; What a depth of love is it for God to offer us his Chriſt, his onely Son in marriage to us; what manner of love is this?</p>

                  <p n="1">1. We call God Father, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.23. Is it a light matter for the God of Heaven and earth to be called your Father, ſince you are but men?</p>

Whereas before you had but rough hewn ſpirits, God ſheds his owne Spirit abroad in us, makes us partakers of the divine nature, that we ſhould have high thoughts of a Kingdome, eternall life.</p>

They never knew what manner of love it is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To reprove a great unworthineſſe of Gods Children, and a ſhamefull diſhonour they put upon him, when they are aſhamed to call him Father. This is the caſe of many of Gods ſervants, when they come in bad company. they cover themſelves with a veil of carnality. What do we loſe by calling God Father, doth not God rather loſe by calling us children? This <hi>Peter's</hi> ſin coſt him many a bitter tear, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.75.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This ſhould teach all the children of God to love God with all heir ſtrength and might. We can never abound too much in love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19.</p>

                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:65998:112"/>Here we may learn how much we are bound to love our Brethren, let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the bowels of our affections, and think we can never ſufficiently love them.

                  <p>The Objection is taken from the miſpriſing of the world, <hi>The world knows no ſuch excellency in them.</hi> To this he anſwers; that this ignorance of theirs ariſeth from the ignorance of Chriſt.</p>

You may hear <hi>Job</hi> complaining of his poor and miſerable eſtate, <hi>Job</hi> 19.18, 19, 20. he had now no more comfort left him then he had skin on his teeth, and therefore he cryes to his friends to pitty him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 22.

The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the body is ſown in corruption, and is raiſed again in incorruption.</hi> Our bodies while we live in this world are ſubject to many ſickneſſes, diſeaſes, agues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in the life to come there ſhall be no noyſe of corruption heard of, our bodies ſhall
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65998:116"/>
then be ſo hardened and ſtrengthened, as that they ſhall be no way capable of corruption or change; yea, the bodies of wicked men ſhall be ſo hardened, that they ſhall not again return into the matter of which they were firſt made; but they ſhall be ſo hardned <hi>ad poenam,</hi> as to ſubſiſt under everlaſting torments: But the bodies of the godly ſhall be ſo ſtrengthned as to receive an eternall weight of glory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Our bodies are ſown in diſhonour, but ſhall be raiſed again in glory,</hi> when we are dead; Though in our life time our bodies were made ſo come y and favourable, yet then they are changed, and ſubject to putrefaction, ſo that we cannot endure to have them long above the ground unburyed, by reaſon of the unſavaory ſmell that comes from them. And you may read that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> bought a field to bury his dead, <hi>Gen.</hi> chap. 23. verſe 4. But in the world to come, we ſhall be as the Sun in the Kingdome of our Father, Matth. 13.43.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Our bodies are here ſown in weakneſſe; but they ſhall be raiſed again in power</hi> You ſee old men here need a ſtaffe to ſuſtain their feeble joynts, but at the day of Judgement then we ſhall need no ſtaffe, for then we ſhall be ſtronger then the ſtrongeſt man that ever lived, ſtronger then any of <hi>David's</hi> Worthies, one of which ſlew 300 men. 2 Sam. 23.18.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Our bodies are ſown naturall bodies, but they ſhall be raiſed ſpirituall bodies</hi> Our bodies here muſt be ſuſtained with meat and drink, elſe they cannot continue; but there we ſhall ſtand in need of none: <hi>Our meat and drink there ſhall be to do the will of our Father which is in heaven.</hi> Our bodies now are ſubject to deſcend, but then they ſhall be made ſo light, that they ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend and paſſe from place to place even in a moment, we ſhall be quick to diſpatch the buſineſſe we are ſent about. As the Sun doth now move with much celerity, ſo faſt, that it doth in the ſpace of a day, run over many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of miles. Now if a naturall body be ſo quick, ſhall not then a ſpiritual body be endued with much more celerity?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As our bodies ſhall be then changed, ſo alſo ſhall our ſouls, now our ſouls are much ſtayned and polluted with ignorance, pride, wantonneſſe, impatience, and full of infirmities, but then we ſhall be perfect in ſtrength and knowledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. Now whileſt we live here, our ſouls are as it were drowned in ſin, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9.6. But then we ſhall not have any combating or ſtriving between the fleſh and the ſpirit, but then the fleſh ſhall in all things be ſubject to the ſpirit. We are now full of imperfections, ſo as the good duties that we perform even in the beſt manner we can, are full of much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty and weakneſſe. Now our naturall affections do whirle us about and carry us away from the performance of good duties oft-times, but then it ſhall be our conſtant courſe to be performing of good duties, we ſhall then know our Chriſtian friends and acquaintance, and rejoyce mutually together, <hi>John</hi> 4.36.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Then will our Saviour lay open before our eyes, all our good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.2. Eccl. 12.14. 2 Theſſ. 1.10. Matth. 6. from 1. to 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We ſhall ſit on the throne of God, and ſhall judge the world and the Angels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2, 3.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We do now count it a great mercy, and matter of great joy to ſee the face of Chriſt in the Goſpel, in his ordinances, how much more will it be joy unſpeakable to ſee Chriſt face to face? And if the ſeeing Chriſt in the Goſpel, in his ordinances, doth in ſome manner transform us into his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then how ſhall we be transformed into his image, when we ſhall feer him face to face? <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23.

It ſhall be our Marriage day, now we are but betrothed to Chriſt, we are now ſo coy that Chriſt hath much adoe to get our good will; the Miniſters of Chriſt travell in birth of us; and when they have got us to give our conſent, it is their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to fit us and trim us againſt that day, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. For we are now full of whoriſh and adultrous luſts, wherefore the Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.1. and in them all us, to cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Although when we have done all we can, we are but unprofitable ſervants, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. yet Chriſt at that day will give us a Kingdome, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.6, 7, to 10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, to 9.</p>

                     <p n="4">4, To exhort every one that would ſee a joyfull and a comfortable end, and receive a crown of glory in the world to come, to have a care that he become the childe of God here, Rom. 8.11. and <hi>not to ſet our affections on the things of this world.</hi> Jam. 4.4.5. You that are to chooſe, make your choice now, whether you will have Chriſt, and a poor, baſe, miſerable life, or cleave to the world, and be in endleſſe torments for ever hereafter.

                        <hi>Doct. 1.</hi> That every childe of God hath hope in Chriſt, to be made like him at his appearing.</head>
                     <p>Every man that is begotten again, is <hi>begotten to a lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3, 4, 5. An hypocrites hope is dead, it hath neither comfort, nor power in it to cleanſe or purge. A childe in the wombe, when they doubt of the life of it, though the parent be very wealthy, yet hath not lively hope of his poſſeſſion; but if the childe be born alive, then there is a comfortable hope: ſo if we be not born again, all our hopes of eternall life are but vain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. It's the property of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God to hope in their God, Pſalm. 130.7.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>What is this hope?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a patient, certain, and grounded expectation of all thoſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Chriſt, which by faith we beleeve to belong unto us. It's a ſure and patient expectation.</p>
                     <p>There are two acts of hope:
<list>
                           <item>1. Expectation.</item>
                           <item>2. Waiting.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is not an expectation of meer opinion, but a ſure expectation. The Apoſtle puts both together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25. Heb. 6.11, 18, 19. An anchor is a ſure and ſtedfaſt ſtay to the ſhip, that though it waves up and downe; yet it hath a certaine ſtay. And ſo a Chriſtians hope, it's like an anchor to ſtay the ſoul, the object of hope is the accompliſhment of the promiſes to come, and ſo differs from faith; no man hopes for that which is preſent or paſt, but that which we ſee not, promiſes that belong to us in reverſion. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13, 14. Heb. 11.1. Faith looks at all promiſes as preſent, faith beleeves that all the promiſes are true, and then hope ſtirs up it ſelfe to look for accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if God tarry long, it waits, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. It's a ſure hope, never was any man diſappointed; and yet hope, though it be ſure, it is not without all doubting. No true Chriſtian but hath this hope.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> That Gods children might not be toſſed and hurryed up and down the world. A childe of God is never carryed far, an anchor ſticks in the foundation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18, 19. While he hold on our hopes, and they are faſtned to Chriſt, we have ſtrong canſolation, hereby are we kept from daſhing againſt rocks, and ſands, and ſhoars; here is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an anchor and hope, an anchor is faſtened in the earth, and hope in heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This may ſhew you the dignity and honour of a Chriſtian. He is a man of great hopes, he will not give his hopes for the beſt mans eſtate in the world, he hath a ſtedfaſt hope of being like Chriſt when he ſees him; though the cloathes he now wears be mean, yet he hopes to be clad with Chriſts righteouſneſſe; and though his houſe be mean, yet he hopes for an houſe
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65998:118"/>
not made with hands; this is his anchor, and this will hold whitherſoever we ſail:</p>
                     <p n="2">2: This may be a ground of tryall, What be the hopes you build upon? There is a double difference between the hopes of a godly and wicked man.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The wicked mans hopes are groundleſſe, he hath no grounds but hopes:</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is fruitleſſe, <hi>Job</hi> 8 11. The hope of an hypocrite that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground, is like a ruſh or flag without water or mire. Graſſe if it have got head, will do well enough without much moyſture or water. Hope without a promiſe wants water to nouriſh it. A spiders web looks like a curious work but it's drawn out of its own bowels, and is ſoone ſwept away; ſo a hypocrite hath no hope but what he ſpins out of his own bowels, he builds upon preſent or future duties, his hope is fruitleſſe, it neither yeelds comfort nor ſelfe-purging. A true Chriſtian rejoyceth in tribulation, but an hypocrite is overthrowne with it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 2, 3. The hope of an hypocrite makes him careleſſe, he takes no pains with his heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.23. Take an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite while he is in proſperity, and he hath great hopes; takes away proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and perhaps it may hold ſtill, for he may hope that friends will do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; when he is sick, he hopes to recover; when he fears death, he hopes for another life, but when death comes, all his hopes are cruſht: But a godly man, he hopes in death, he hopes for Gods goodneſſe, his hope will never fail him, nor make him aſhamed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hence learn, that hope and knowledge of the ſame thing may well ſtand together; In the former <hi>verſe;</hi> he ſaith, <hi>We know,</hi> here he <hi>hopes.</hi> A mans hope ceaſeth not in order to another world; for do not the Saints beleeve that their bodies ſhall riſe again? and do not they hope for it; They know the perperpetuity of their eſtates, and they hope for it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This ſhould ſtir us up, as we would have a comfortable death, and ſafe, not to goe to Sea without this anchor of hope. The world is full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, carry your anchor about with you, ſee your hope well wrought, and you ſhall be ſafe. Mariners goe not to Sea without an anchor, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſometimes though they have pitched their anchor in the bottome of the Sea, yet the ſtorms may be ſo great, that they may be forced to cut the cable; woman in childebed may be put to diſtreſſe, but hope in heaven will carry her through.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>How may we get this hope?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We can never come to it, till we be out of hope of any goodneſſe in our ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2: We muſt attend upon God in his ordinances, that ſo he may work faith in us; and where there is faith, there will be ſtrings of hope, hope is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on faith.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>How ſhall we carry it about with us?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Look at it as a mercy that you have it, ſtay your ſelves upon your anchor, look afreſh at the promiſes, and believe them, then thou ſhalt have hope enough: That which makes unquiet, is becauſe we have not viſited the promiſes many a day, nor renewed our faith in them.</p>

                     <p>The lively hope of a Chriſtian here, is ſet forth by the lively fruit of ſelfe-purging, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14. <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>How doth this hope thus purifie us?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1: By the holy meditations it doth ſuggeſt into the heart of every hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtian:</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="231" facs="tcp:65998:118"/>1. A Chriſtian that knows he hath long been impriſoned in the fetters of corruption, and knows he ſhall ſhortly be called to appear before God; it makes him to put off all ſuperfluity of uncleanneſſe, and to put on the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of holineſſe. Shall I come before Chriſt inveſted in pride and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? This makes him carefull to purifie himſelfe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.32. Can a Maid forget her ornaments when ſhe is to be married? and can a Chriſtian forget ſuch ornaments as may befit him for ſuch a Kingdome?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A ſecond meditation which provokes a hoping Chriſtian to purifie himſelfe, is this, He conſiders, the more he is purged and purified, the more he is cleanſed, the greater ſhall his glory be, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hope purifies by ſetting ſome graces on work, which doe cleanſe and purifie: As,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Repentance is a grace that purgeth us from ſin, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 130.1, 2, 3</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith purifies our hearts, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. If God ſtir but up our hearts to wait on him, we may certainly know that he will do ſo as we have deſired, elſe our hope would make us aſhamed, Pſalm 119. 49. <hi>Remember thou the word un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſervant in which thou haſt made me to truſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3 The meditation of the graces in Chriſt transform us into their image, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. There is ſuch a power in the promiſes of God, that they faſhion us like unto Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Hope cleanſeth us, by giving us hearts faſtening on the Word, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it; and the Word applyed hath a ſtrong power to cleanſe even young men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This hope hath a power to ſtir us up to faithfulneſſe, which hope per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us our labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord, and this faithfulneſſe ſets God on work to purge us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2. that we may bring forth more fruits. When God ſeeth us to ſtand at a ſtay, and to wax b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="3">3. Hope to be made like to Chriſt in glory hereafter makes us to abandon ſuch impediments as hinder our purification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. When he ſaith, that <hi>every one that hath this hope purifies himſelf,</hi> it implyes it is a continued work, he makes it a part of his daily work.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>He purgeth himſelfe,</hi> he doth not ſay from what, from wantonneſſe; and leaves covetouſneſſe behinde, he leaves it indefinitely, he includes all, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes none, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. This hope purgeth the whole man, the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, will, and affections, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. Well then may it be called a lively fruitfull hope.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Hope comes to all the ordinances of God, with expectation that it ſhall finde benefit from the Word, prayer, and good company. Hope waits on God for good in every ordinance, and then it never goes away empty; it ſtrive, before it comes to prepare the heart, and to cleanſe it from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This may diſcover unto us the wonderfull loathſomneſſe of ſin. If ſin were not an excrement, why ſhould we purge it out? We purge out nothing but filthy loathſome things, and therefore when hope is ſaid to purge, it implyes that ſin is loathſome.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Hence diſcern the ſoundneſſe of our hope. Do you finde your hearts daily striving to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If thy hope do not ſet thee on work every day to cleanſe thy heart, truly thy hope is nothing but a vain deluſion, and nothing will more ſting thee at the laſt day, when thou ſhalt hope for heaven, thou ſhalt be caſt out of Gods preſence.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Let it teach all Chriſtians, as they would not be aſhamed of their hopes, to <hi>make their calling and election ſure.</hi> Let their hopes make them purge and cleanſe themſelves. And let not Chriſtians think it is enough to purge themſelves, but they muſt purge their families. A Chriſtian muſt ſuffer none in his family to be uncircumciſed. God would have killed <hi>Moſes</hi>

                     <p>Set before you a pattern of a cloud of witneſſes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. He that abides in Chriſt, ought to walk as he hath walked.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. From the end of Gods predeſtination. <hi>He hath predeſtinated us to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the image of his Son,</hi> Rom. 8.29. And God in all things requires that we ſhould <hi>grow up to the fellowſhip of the ſtature of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the perfection of the pattern. All other patterns of godly men will fail us in ſome things, but Chriſt is a perfect pattern, he will fail us in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.

If they cannot endure the brightneſſe of a candle, how will they endure the brightneſs of the Sun? and yet they ſay, they love Chriſt. But if they have not purity, how can they love Chriſt? and if they love not Chriſt, they are accurſed for ever.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This reproves thoſe, who though they do not hate purity, yet, they think themſelves very well, if they exceed the worſt ſort of men; they are no whore-mongers, nor theeves, nor deceivers.

                     <p n="4">4. This reproves another ſort of Chriſtians, who if they have got but ſuch a meaſure of grace, as they are aſſured to be in a ſtate of grace, they never look further, but now they look out for themſelves in the world, as if they might reſt in what is behinde, and never preſſe forward to what is before them, contrary to <hi>Paul:</hi> Know, O Chriſtian, it is not enough to get truth of grace, nor ſome purity, but you muſt grow pure as Chriſt is pure.</p>

This may exhort us all, as we would maintain our hope to be made like Chriſt hereafter, ſo to ſtrive to this exactneſſe of purity, <hi>to purifie our ſelves as he is pure.</hi> If you would be hopefull Chriſtians, you muſt be growing Chriſtians, <hi>growing up to the meaſure of the purity of Chriſt;</hi> decay in growing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you decay in hope. No Chriſtian ſo full of joy and hope, as he that is every day getting ſomething, and <hi>growing up to perfection,</hi> 1 John 2.6. Phil. 3.12, 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Motives to ſtir us up to grow in grace.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. So ſoon as you ſlack this care, your hope, faith, and grace waxeth weak. If we ſee our bodies do not voyd excrements for many dayes, we think our bodies are not in a good ſtate but ſome diſeaſes lye on us. How can we have an healthfull ſoul, when we purge not our corruption many a day?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the great uncomelineſſe that is in us, if we do not ſtrive to be pure. Is it not an uncomely thing to ſee the head to be of gold, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers partly braſſe, partly clay and dirt?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It's very grievous to the Spirit of God, that we ſhould be no better for all it hath dwelt ſo long in us. When Chriſt had been long with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65998:119"/>
and they were not bettered by him, he up braids them, <hi>O fooliſh and ſlow of heart to believe! how long ſhall I be with you?</hi> It was a griefe to Chriſt that he ſhould be long with his Diſciples, and they not to grow up to ſtrength of grace.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But doth not virtue conſiſt in a golden mean?</hi>

You may exceed the bounds of righteouſneſſe, and ſo be unrighteous; but you cannot exceed the degrees of righteouſneſſe, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect.</hi> Can you then be too pure and holy.

                     <p n="4">4. As ever you deſire to be worthy partakers of the Sacrament, then labour to purifie your ſelves. The reaſon why many a chriſtian comes to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and finds no comfort, is, becauſe they grieved the Spirit of God before they came, by neglecting to caſt out thoſe obſtructions which hinder the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the head to the members, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30, 31.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Means to help us to purifie our ſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Be perſwaded that you are not in a ſafe eſtate, till you are grown up to ſome good meaſure of purity. You would think him in a poor caſe, that ſhould live 200 years, and yet for want of evacuation ſhould live in ſickneſſe and weakneſſe. And ſo a chriſtian is in an uncomfortable eſtate unleſſe he purge himſelfe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Be very watchfull over thy wayes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Uſe the ordinances of God conſtantly. Say not after converſion, It is no matter whether we be alwayes converſant in Gods ordinances, but at ſome times, when the Spirit moves us. Labour we to carry our ſelves not as idle hearers, but as faithfull doers; labour we to ſee our ſpots and deformities, and ſtrive to purge them, labour we to practiſe new duties, as they are renewed to us.</p>

To reprove ſuch as are afraid to breake mens Laws, for feare of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, and are ſenſible of ſuch dangers, but are not afraid to violate and breake the holy and righteous Lawes of God. This argues a moſt rebellious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting heart. Such are not hopefull chriſtians.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To teach and exhort us to make conſcience of all our wayes, and to take heed to our paths, leſt we tranſgreſſe the Law, and ſin againſt God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9.

For though man ſeeth not, yet God ſeeth and will puniſh, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.11, 12. If we think to get honour, profit, or pleaſure by ſin, we deceive our ſelves. Is it not as grievous a thing to have our ſoule wounded by our darling childe, as our mortall enemy? It is all one to be ſtabbed to the heart with a pen knife and with a ſword. Every ſin wounds and rents our hearts. Abſtain we from all ſin, even the leaſt ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This refutes ſuch as think the Law is not given to the regenerate. The Apoſtle here encourageth hopefull chriſtians not to tranſgreſſe the Law.</p>

                     <p>Obj. <hi>As Chriſts paſſive obedience freeth from the curſe, ſo his active obedience freeth from the commanding power of the Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Chriſt hath done this, and therefore thoſe that are in Chriſt fear not death by their diſobedience, nor look for life by their obedience; but we look at the Law as a rule of obedience, that we may walke according to God, and ſhew that we live by endeavouring to keep his commandements. Take heed of Satans ſlights, that would make the Goſpel a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to the Law in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain things; pray not, preach not, but when the Spirit moveth. Thus you ſhall ſet up a Spirit of deluſion.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This is a perfect definition of <hi>ſin; tranſgreſſion</hi> is the <hi>genus,</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>difference.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ir is in effect and ſubſtance the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. Though the Law of nature was more dimly and darkly known, <hi>Moſes</hi> law was but a new draught of the Law of nature in innocency. Heathen Law-givers, Philoſophers, and Poets have expreſſed the effect of all the commandements ſave the tenth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2, 14.15.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Was it not a ſin to tranſgreſſe the Ceremoniall and Judiciall Law?</hi>
                     </p>

of the ſecond Commandement, and the Judiciall Law doth but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the ſecond Table. The Judiciall, in regard of the equity, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the morall Law, the Ceremoniall ſtood in force till Chriſt dyed.</p>
                     <p>Obj. 3 <hi>Is it not a ſin to tranſgreſſe the Goſpel? and is not unbeliefe a ſin?</hi> Joh. 16.9. <hi>Is not new obedience required in the Goſpel?</hi> Joh. 14.21. Ezek. 36.27. <hi>What ſay you to the commandements of the Goſpel, that we ſhould walke as Chriſt walked?</hi>

What is our buſineſſe in this world? if it be to follow the luſt of our owne hearts, to regard our profits and pleaſure, and we delight in ſin, and what croſſeth us, we maligne, and are at enmity with it. The Scripture doth not call a man the child of the Devill, when he is but meerly naturall, deprived of grace, and prone to ſin; men are then called the children of the devill, when as they are in the boſome of the Church, and ſee the way they ſhould walk in, and that their eſtate is not good, and yet are reſolved to do evill, to take pains in it, and if any croſſe them, they will be at enmity with them; there will be private grudges between many, but when it is for righteouſneſſe ſake, then they are of the ſeed of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuch men as are the children of the devill, may poſſibly become better 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. two laſt verſes. They may be delivered out of the ſnares of Satan. But this God never doth, but with ſuch conflicts, as it may be ſeen there hath been ſtrife between <hi>Micael</hi> and his Angels, and the Devill and his angels. Take a man meerly naturall, and it is an eaſie matter to bring him home, <hi>Jude</hi> verſ. 22, 23. ſhews, that when we are meerly naturall, tenderneſſe of compaſſion

prevails much.</p>
                  <p>There is leſſe oppoſition againſt grace, then when the Devill is come into the heart, and joyns with ſin. The Devill caſt a thought into <hi>Judas</hi> heart to betray Chriſt, <hi>John,</hi> 13.2. he did not preſenly conſent to it, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ill had poſſeſſion of him before, ſetting his heart in a courſe of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but now he had a farther poſſeſſion of him, now he reſolves to betray Chriſt and now he ſpies a time to bring it about. The Devill findes us fleſh and blood at the firſt, then he tempts us to ſin; if we begin to run to him, then he enters, and ſets us in that way. When a new temptations comes, and we conſider whether we ſhall do it or no, when we break off, we are the better, and get ſtrength againſt ſin. But if we yeeld, and commit ſin willingly, then we are the children of the Devill. Take we heed of pleaſing our ſelves in any ſinfull eſtate. If we have committed ſin willingly, and the Devil come with full ſail into our ſouls; if we now lye down in peace, we ſhall be the children of Satan. This is to give our ſouls and hearts to the Devill, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.15, 16. Sin of rebellion is not of ignorance, but through depravation of will. when out of reſolution a man will ſin againſt God, he will make bold with God, this is a ſin of witchcraft. As in a ſin of witchcraft a man or woman give their ſouls to the devill; ſo when a man commits ſin willingly, he gives his foul to the Devill. You would think it a ſtrange thing to be called a Witch, therefore reſt not in this condition.</p>

And if Satan find ſuch pleaſure in ſin, then you may much more finde comfort in well-doing. If he be not weary to aggravate his own ſin and miſery, be not you weary in getting grace and peace to your ſelves and others.

                     <p>But how did Chriſt coming into the world looſe works of Satan?</p>

                        <hi>How doth this manifeſt difference apear?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A double ſigne of it, 1 Cor. 12.10. It is a ſpirituall gift of diſcerning. He ſpeaks of diſcerning what gifts, and what meaſures a man hath, and wherein the ſtrength of a mans gifts lies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 15. Although he cannot diſcern eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans ſpeciall gifts, what he is moſt fit for, yet plain and manifeſt things he diſcerns, and alſo between morall and ſpirituall, between things of God, and Satan, and the World.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond manifeſtation of this difference is the inclination of the end of the one and of the other. <hi>By their fruits ye ſhall know them,</hi> Mat. 7.20. Gal. 5.19.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>Cannot an hypocrite paſſe ſo as that he cannot be diſcerned? What ſay you of Judas, he was not diſcerned of a long time,</hi> Mat. 26.22. <hi>for every of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples began to ſuſpect themſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Again, Gods people carry things ſo weakly, and the pulſe of Gods grace beats ſo weakly, as if no life and ſtrength were in them,</hi> 1 Kings 19.17, 18. Pſalm 12.1.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sometimes hypocriſie is ſpun with ſo fine a thread, and it is ſo well dyed, as that you can hardly diſcern any difference. And ſometimes grace is ſo low in the heart, as that you cannot diſcern it. This is true, but it is but for a time. <hi>Judas</hi> at length was plainly known to have been but a theef, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> can do miracles as well as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> but in time they ſhall be diſcerned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22, 45. Lay hands ſuddenly on no man; for if he prove not pure, thou ſhalt be pertaker of his ſins, and all the hurt he doth. Some mens ſins lye open before hand, <hi>i. e.</hi> before the judgement of the Church, others follow after, they cannot be hid, God will have them made manifeſt in due time, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.2. There is nothing ſo ſecret but it will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. If you put leaven into five pecks of meal, it will not alwayes lye hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but in time break forth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. An argument of juſt reproof to good men and bad. If after a while we know not our ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. As if it were a dangerous ſign of a mans ſeparation from God, if after ſo long a time of the Apoſtles preaching, they knew not what was in them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This reproves the Popiſh Doctors, that ſay no man can diſcern his owne eſtate. They alledge that place, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.1, 2. A man cannot know by outward things whether he be in Gods favour or not. If a man come in a ſheep-skin, I ſhall take him to be a ſheep, Mat. 7.16, to 20.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To teach every one to take heed of a devilliſh ſpirit, or any unrighteous courſe of life; for though a man may hide it long, yet at length it will be known. It is as impoſſible that a mans want of love ſhould not be known, as for a man to keep fire in his boſome, and it not to break out, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 36 2, 3, 4.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Of exhortation to all that are born of God, not alwayes to ſmoother grace; God will have your grace manifeſt, and that to edifie withall, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. Do not content your ſelves with cloſe and houſhold Chriſtianity, but manifeſt of what ſpirit you are. It was commendable in <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to hide her ſelfe ſix moneths, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.6. When ſhe was ſtirring with childe, then ſhe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Couſen <hi>Mary.</hi> So if God have wrought any conception of grace in our hearts, it doth well to be concealed a while, leſt like the ſtony ground, in time of perſecution it ſhould fall away. When thou art ſure there is a manifeſt work of Gods Spirit in thy heart, then manifeſt thy ſelfe.</p>

A man may be angry towards thoſe he

Breake one commandement, break all, for who gave one, gave all; whoſo neglects offices of love to

one, performes none to any, nor to God. It is a note of ſincerity, that a man hates all ſin, as well as one, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.101, 104 For it is an argument of love, when there is no Brother or Siſter but we enlarge our affections towards them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. So much want of love, ſo much hypocriſie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the bitter or deadly root of want of love to this or that Brother. It ſprings from two occaſions,
<list>
                           <item>1. Either from his infirmities in himſelfe: Or,</item>
                           <item>2. From ſpirituall injuries to our ſelves.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>True, a man will ſay, ſuch Chriſtians I would away with, but they have ſuch unſavoury corruptions. The firſt root of this is the condemnation of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods people. If a man may condemn this or that man, for this or that corruption, he may come to condemn the beſt of Gods ſervants, becauſe the beſt of Gods ſervants may be in the ſame failings for which thou hateſt ſuch a Brother, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12. The greateſt of Gods ſervants have ſhamefully faln, <hi>David, Peter, Lot, Noah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond root is from the enmity againſt Gods free juſtification of ſinners. Take away this, and you take away all Chriſtian religion. If you love not a Brother, becauſe of ſome infirmities, you doe overthrow the free juſtification of Gods grace of a ſinner. For God that hath juſtified the greateſt, hath juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as well the leaſt, as freely and as fully; and wilt thou juſtifie ſome, and condemn others? God condemns none, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.33, 34. If Chriſtians doe beleeve the free juſtification of ſinners, then let us imitate our Father which is in heaven, juſtifie whom he juſtifies.</p>
                     <p>The third bitter and deadly root. If there be the leaſt ſparke of grace in his heart, all his corruptions are his enemies, and he but a ſhrimp in grace, and hath many enemies. What good nature is this, when a man would love a man if he had no enemies? but when he hath enemies, and ſuch as are ready ever and anon to beat him down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he cannot love him.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, want of a member like ſpirit: for the more naked, unſeemly, or deformed any member is, the body is the more carefull of it; if it may be, it ſhall be healed; if not, it ſhall be covered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.23, 24. If we want this, it flowes from want of a member like ſpirit.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Somtimes neglect of our Brother ſprings from ſome perſonall injury done to our ſelves. We cannot love them. This ſprings from this root, want of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of our own ſins; for we pray for forgiveneſſe upon this ground, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12, 15. Our Saviour gives a reaſon of this above all, there is no ſurer argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then this. A Chriſtian may reaſon thus: If I that have but a little ſparke of grace, can forgive injuries, how ſhall not the Ocean of love much more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me? <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>ult.</hi> God will never have us to think, that if we cannot forgive one injury, he will forgive us a thouſand. Yet a man is not alwayes bound to expreſſe his forgiveneſſe, unleſſe a man come and ſay, it repents him; yet from his heart he muſt doe it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Shewes the dangerous and fearfull eſtate of a man that dares live in envy and malice againſt his brethren. A man thinks he hath cauſe, he will not receive the Sacrament, nor ſuffer them. What a poor thing is this? Thou haſt not thy ſins forgiven, thou loveſt not God, nor any Chriſtian ſoul in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God. A Chriſtian dares not allow himſelfe in hatred of any Brother, but looks at it as an enemy to his ſoul.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It exhorts every Chriſtian to enlarge the bowels of his affection to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Brother, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.63. <hi>I am a companion to all them that fear thee.</hi> He doth not pick and chooſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. If to all men, then <hi>eſpecially to the houſhold of faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is a ground of thankfullneſſe to God, that hath taken care for weakeſt Chriſtians; for want of love to ſuch; God will either diſcharge a man for an hypocrite, or elſe his own corruption ſhall take him by the throat, and make him beleeve that many ſins are not forgiven, and that he ſhall hardly get par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſins.</p>

                     <p n="4">4 Of exhortation, to take a view of Gods love, that we may be able to ſay freely, We perceive the love of God. Reſt not in any ſpirituall duty, nor in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny common gift, till you know that Chriſt dyed for thee.</p>

                     <p n="5">5 To encourage Gods ſervants to expect offices of love from God to us and ours all his dayes. He hath given his Son, what would you have more? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11.

                     <p n="1">1 Conſcience uſeth to be an obſerver and ſpyer of what a man is, and what a man doth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.10. Another knows not what a man is, but himſelfe doth. Conſcience is a good companion of the good, the worſt of the bad. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.15. <hi>A good conſcience is a feaſt.</hi> There is good company where a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is.

Thus Conſcience doth to good men upon ſome occaſions. So <hi>David,</hi> when he had numbred the people, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. <hi>I have done very fooliſhly,</hi> he ſpeaks with ſome bitterneſſe of heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37.

                     <p n="1">1. That God might manifeſt his being. There is no ſtronger evidence of Gods being: For to whom doth it witneſſe? Is it not to God? Before whom doth it condemn, or to whom is it an executioner, if there were no God?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His own providence. And we muſt not think that God mindes not things below; if he did not, why is Conſcience afraid and comforted, if God did not look into Conſcience?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 For Gods juſtice, that he might magnifie it. God proceeds in his Judicial courſe, without any witneſſe but Conſcience: If God have none to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, how ſhall he magnifie his juſtice in condemning ſecret ſins?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Gods mercy. If God be angry with a man, it is an advantage to a man that he knows it, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.

                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. God is our witneſſe, therefore when we ſpeak ſoberly, we call God to witneſſe: He is a Judge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.3. an Executioner; and therefore if Conſcience ſees cauſe to condemn us, God much more; if Conſcience ſee cauſe to acquit us, God much more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2, 3.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Conſcience ſometimes bears falſe witneſſe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15, 16. If a man have a defiled conſcience, it will deal falſly. A mans conſcience through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and partiality, doth bring a falſe verdict: As it is many times with a Jury, ignorance of law, and falſe evidence, makes them bring a falſe verdict; but then ſend them back again, and ſhew them better evidence, and the law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So Conſcience doth oft-times bring a falſe verdict, but its thorough igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Law of God, or partiality. Doth thy conſcience ſpeak bitter things? Conſider what the grounds are. If ſuch as doe argue thee dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins, then know that God doth call thee from heaven to repentance. If it tell thee thou art an hypocrite, conſider what grounds it hath, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be muzled by ignorance and partiality; the Devill puts falſe glaſſes before our eyes.</p>

                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. Pray to God with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 19. to cleanſe us from ſuch ſins which we know not. We have confeſſed ſuch ſins as we know by our ſelves, and thoſe which the world knows by us, but we muſt make a new reckoning for ſuch ſins as we know not.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Not to truſt our own hearts, but the Word of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. The Word of God ſaith, there are ſuch ſins in every age, therefore we muſt pray to God to help us againſt them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Keep our hearts with all diligence, obſerve every winding and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and take heed of occaſions that provoke our hearts any way to ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23.</p>

                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:65998:137"/>2. This ſhews the impoſſibility of their good eſtates that look to be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by habits and works. It is the happineſſe of Gods ſervants, in that they look not to be juſtified by the perfection of their hearts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Ground of tryall. If we finde that our hearts doe not condemn us, let us truſt our hearts no farther then we prove them by the rule of Gods Word. If God hath helped you to look up to Chriſt for the pardon of your ſins, and you now ſit looſe from ſin, it is an argument that your ſins are pardoned, becauſe we could not elſe hate ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. But on the contrary, if we finde our hearts condemning us, our hearts are full of ſelfe-love. Parents are full of partiality, as that they can ſcarce ſee any evill in their children: If they ſee cauſe of death in them, much more God the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge; If they ſee cauſe of condemnation in them, the Judge much more.</p>

He that hath this hope, ſhall never be aſhamed before God or men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. This rejoycing is a companion of boldneſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wherein ſtands this boldneſſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> In three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In liberty of ſpirit, to ask thoſe things at Gods hands that are meet for us. This we may doe with ſome boldneſſe and liberty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Let us go boldly to the throne of grace,</hi> he means in prayer. A Chriſtian that hath the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for his High Prieſt, who hath reconciled him to God, to him Gods throne is not a Judgement-ſeat, but a Mercy-ſeat and he begs mercy to help him in time of need; we may ſafely expect, God will not deny what we ask, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. The Apoſtle tells us by his own example, he never prays for them, but his heart is warmed with joy, and he was confident God would grant what he prayed for. <hi>We come to a throne of grace;</hi> that is, we may ſpeak as favourites to God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Boldneſſe in dangers that may befall in this world, or another. He walks fearleſſe and ſecurely againſt the fear of danger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>ult. Doubtleſſe loving kindneſſe and mercy ſhall follow me all my days. Surely,</hi> or <hi>doubtleſſe.</hi> This is a bold ſpeech, to aſſure himſelfe that goodneſſe and mercy ſhall follow him whitherſoever he goes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 In expectation of all good things, whether we pray for them or not. God many times will have more care of us, then we of our ſelves. <hi>Paul</hi> was in a ſtraight, he knew it would be better for him to be <hi>diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt,</hi> yet better for the Church, if he ſhould in the fleſh, and he is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he ſhall ſtay with them to their joyes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.24, 25. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.23, 24. There was a readineſſe of heart in him, ſo to carry all things, as that he might rejoyce in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1 From the juſtification by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, to 5. <hi>We rejoyce in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, hope never makes aſhamed.</hi> The ſoul is never at peace, till ſuch time as by faith it doth receive and apply Chriſts righteouſneſſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.5. A man that owes another man money, and knows not how to pay him, he is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to come into his ſight. He that knows he hath injured his Prince, and that he doth watch an occaſion to be revenged of him, he will be afraid and aſhamed.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="269" facs="tcp:65998:137"/>2. The ſincerity of his ſanctification. Though a man hath aſſurance that his ſins are pardoned, and that he is a childe of God, yet if he walk crookedly and looſly in his own wayes, his conſcience will be ſo perplexed and diſtracted, as that he will think every hand of God comes as a judgement, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. Here is his boldneſſe, he hath walked in ſimplicity and pureneſſe. A man is fearfull and aſhamed when he hath dealt doubly either with God or man, or walked in ſome way of impurity of heart. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Davids</hi> bones were broken, he could not ſtand upright, he could not look God in the face. When God gives a man to walk in ſimplicity without guile, and pureneſſe without uncleanneſſe, then a man may walk boldly, and with joy, otherwiſe he walks like a criple, and creeps up and down.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1 It reproves an old cavill that hath been in the world, that Religion makes men Daſtards and Cowards; No, rather want of Religion: If men had but purity of heart and good conſcience towards men, they would fear no dangers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Refutation of all Popery. They cannot be bold, becauſe they cannot know God to be their Father, they keep not a good conſcience. Where there is no good conſcience, there is no boldneſſe. Wicked men indeed may be bold through ignorance, or through abundance of natural ſpirits, mettle, courage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This may be in Papiſts, and was found in Heathens.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 A ground of tryall of a mans peace, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. Thou art at peace. D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="4">4 This teacheth us the true way of boldneſſe. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> praiſeth God that he can think of his former evills without fear. If thou wouldſt doe thus, ſtrive with God that he would ſprinkle thy ſoule with the blood of Chriſt. If thou haſt found peace of juſtification with God, labour for peace of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Let no rebellious luſts be in thy ſoule, but complain of it to the Lord, and fight againſt them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Much conſolation to a childe of God, that walks in ſimplicity of a good conſcience. If God hath given thee an heart to loath all wickedneſſe, and abandon all occaſions of ſin, there is a boldneſſe ſpringing in thy heart. A childe of God hath boldneſſe, but he ſees it overclouded, he knows not wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From a rule of equity, which God uſeth in diſpenſing himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.2. As we diſpenſe our ſelves to him, ſo doth God himſelfe to us. This it a generall rule of Gods walking towards men. With what meaſure we mete, God will meaſure to us again. If we let no Word of God fall to the ground, but our conſcience ſtand in awe of it, and our hearts cleave to it, God will let none of our prayers fall to the ground.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the unity of the Spirit that doth help us to keep the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. God makes account we keep the commandements, when there is none but our judgements approve, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. The Spirit helps us to pray, and it asks things according to the will of God, and he knows the meaning of the Spirit. As who ſhould ſay, He that prayes not in the Spirit is a <hi>Barbarian</hi> unto God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From the love and reſpect God bears to them that keep his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is the way to become Gods Favourite, <hi>John</hi> 14.21, 23.</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. It ſhews us the cauſe of the fruitleſneſſe of our prayers at any time, God hears not us, becauſe we hear not him. If our prayer fall to the ground, then ſurely Gods Word hath faln to the ground. A good prayer and a bad life can never meet, <hi>James</hi> 2.20. If we live in awleſſe reſpect to Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, he hears not our prayers.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Encouragement to the obedience of Gods commandements. What comfort would a man have more then to have his wiſh? If God give thee an heart to keep all his commandements, thou mayſt aſſure thy heart, that all thy petitions are granted.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A ground of comfort to every ſuch ſoule as makes conſcience of his wayes. If thou walkeſt with a care to fulfill Gods will, he will fulfill thine. Such as give themſelves to walk as Chriſt hath walked, may have this comfort, <hi>John</hi> 11.32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.5, 6. Such petitions as are long delayed, and ſeem to be moſt ſtrongly denyed, are fulfilled, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.3, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Daniels</hi> prayers were heard the firſt day, but not then anſwered. A petition is granted in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and a courſe taken for the accompliſhment of it, but yet there muſt be a time to bring it about, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.25, 26. Though God delay our prayers, yet even then he grants them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. God regards the hearts of his people, and their movings. <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired onely to ſee the good Land, God bid him go up to the hill, and ſo ſtrengthened his ſight to ſee it; he ſhould not go over, becauſe the people ſhould ſee Gods diſpleaſure againſt him. We have an end alwayes in our prayers, and we preſcribe means to God, he many times denies the means in diſpleaſure, but gives the end, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8. So it was in <hi>Paul,</hi> God would not remove the meſſenger of Satan, but he did that by it which he would have done, the free paſſage of the ſpirit in his heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. A Chriſtian prays for the light of his countenance, God hears not, Why doſt thou deſire it, to ſtrengthen thy faith? He will doe it by the word of promiſe. We pray that God would mortifie ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, Why doe we deſire it, that grace may have free paſſage in our hearts? God will by ſuch luſts mortifie a greater, that is, pride of heart; and God works ſuch a loathing in thy heart, and bitterneſſe in regard of ſin, that we might mortifie them.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond benefit is the acceptance of all our prayers in the preſence of God, amplified by an argument taken from the practice of ſuch men whoſe

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, As they keep a good conſcience on earth, ſo they keep favour in heaven, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.5.

Thus did <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Ib. 29.2. So did <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.25. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.2.</p>
                     <p>What is it to keep Gods commandements?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not barely to keep them in our minds and memory; but, Firſt, to keep them as one would keep his high-way: A traveller, ſo ſoon as he is out of his way, and ſees it, he blames himſelfe for it, and haſtens to get into it again. Secondly, as a man would keep his jewells, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.20, 21. Thirdly, to keep it as the apple of our eye, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.1, 2, 3. If the leaſt more fall into our eye, we never leave till we get it out; ſo we muſt make ſcruple of the leaſt ſins. Fourthly, we muſt keep the commandements as we would keep our life. Now, <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life:</hi> So we ſhould loſe our lives, and all we have for Gods commandements</p>

                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> From the ſuitableneſſe of the will or commandements of God, and the conſcience of a Chriſtian. You pleaſe a man when you doe that which is according to his will; and ſo look what is good in Gods ſight, that is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods commandements. The commandements of God are a lively i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his will. God is a God of pure eyes, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. he hateth wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4.

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Hence we may have a tryall of our conſcience, whether it be good or no, for upon the goodneſſe of our conſcience depends the peace of this world, and another, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. Examine your ſelves, Doe you keep Gods commandements as a man would keep his way, the apple of his eye, his life and ſoul, or his Jewells? Elſe you doe not keep a good conſcience. There are four ſorts of conſciences.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, There is a conſcience which is good, but yet not quiet: Such was <hi>Davids,</hi> Pſal. 31.22. when he ſaid in his haſt, <hi>he was utterly caſt out of his ſight;</hi> though it was good, yet it did not ſpeak the truth concerning <hi>David.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is a conſcience which is neither good nor quiet; ſuch was <hi>Judas</hi> his conſcience, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.3, 4.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There is a conſcience both good and peaceable, which walks in Gods commandements; and if he ſlip out of Gods commandements, he looks at himſelfe as out of the way; he finds refreſhments in walking in Gods ways, he could not by any means part with Gods commandements, he had rather part with his life, and all that he hath.

He doth therefore add <hi>Name</hi> to the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> becauſe we do believe in Chriſt by thoſe attributes given to him, it is by Chriſt we are ſaved. Now if we did not conſider him, as a Prieſt, a Prophet, and a King, he could not have ſaved us, theſe offices of Chriſt are the name of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>What is meant by believing in his Name?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> There are three acts of Faith in believing in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:65998:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>1. To be perſwaded of his goodneſſe and promiſes. Doubting is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Doubting and perſwaſion are</hi> acts of the minde.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith is an act of a mans will, whereby he truſts on the name of the Lord Jeſus. Not to beleeve in God, is not to truſt on God for his ſalvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.22. <hi>Credere in Chriſtum,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. is as it were to rowle our ſelves upon Chriſt. There are two things in Gods promiſes: <list>
                           <item>1. Truth.</item>
                           <item>2. Goodneſſe.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> believes the <hi>truth, will</hi> accepts and cloſes with the <hi>goodneſſe.</hi> Theſe be acts about a promiſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is a true faith, but yet weak, which doth not reach to thoſe, and yet reach to believeing in his Name, and hath ſalvation by his Name; which is, when a man can abide by the Lord, and will not away till he bleſſe him, like <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen 32.26. This is the ſame with drawing neer to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.28. A man draws neer to God, when he is willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake all his luſts, and can find no ſatisfaction in earthly things, but onely in the Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. It is a work of greater honour to God to believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, then to love God, when we know him to be our friend. When a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth firſt begin to believe in Chriſt, he doth not take God as a friend, but as an enemy; now, to cleave to God when he is an enemy, is more then to love God when he is a friend unto us. For a ſoul to throw it ſelf on God when he is terrible, and ſeems as an angry God; now, not to let him go till he ſhews us mercy, is a famous thing. The faith of a weak Chriſtian becomes more famous then the love of a ſtrong Chriſtian. The one hath had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Gods love, the other never felt the warmth of Gods Spirit in the heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This doth magnifie the grace of God, becauſe ſuch a ſoul as believes in Chriſt, doth rely on Chriſt for every bleſſing; he doth not truſt on the beſt graces he hath received, he doth not truſt on his own faith, but he truſts on Chriſt for the favour of God, and he believes that for his ſake every promiſe ſhall be fulfilled. This great commandment gives God &amp; Chriſt all the honour.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe by faith we reſt on God for all the good we ſtand in need of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. From the wickedneſſe of our nature, and impoſſibility to love God, before we truſt God, and before we be perſwaded that our ſins are forgiven. The end of the commandement is love. Whence comes this love? From faith unfained, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>John</hi> 14.1. Chriſts diſciples were much troubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was to leave the world, but he labours to comfort them, ſaying, <hi>Believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> but <hi>verſe</hi> 6. No man muſt think to believe in God, before they believe in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This reproves a ſinfull error of the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſay that Faith may be ſevered from Love. A man may believe in God and yet not love him. Which is contrary to this great commandment. We, do no ſooner believe in God, but we love him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To exhort every ſoul, as they would deſire to do any thing pleaſing to God, to make this their greateſt duty, to <hi>believe in the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Faith and Love are correlatives. Let no man flatter himſelf in this, That he is born of good parents, that he lives in the boſome of the Church, and that he enjoyes Gods ordinances, but truſt thou on the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. Now, we cannot truſt on God before we know him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It teacheth this: That this believing on the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, is a divine thing. For Chriſt Jeſus is no creature, but equall with the Father, <hi>John</hi> 14.1.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Of comfort to every ſoul that believes in the Name of the Lord Jeſus. He fulfils this great commandement. Is not this a great comfort to a man, when he knows there is little that he can either do or ſuffer, but yet this he is perſwaded of, that he abides in Chriſt Jeſus, and truſts in God.</p>

                        <hi>Doct. 2.</hi> The ſecond great commandement is that we love one another.</head>
                     <p>When the ſcribe asked Chriſt, <hi>What was the greateſt commandement of the Law?</hi> Mat. 22.36. Chriſt anſwers him, <hi>And the ſecond is like to it: Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. John</hi> ſaith here, to <hi>love one another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the large extent of it. The is no duty or office of love which we perform to man, but is comprehended in this, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> Rom. 13.10. Love not your neighbour, and you break all the commandements of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe whatſoever we do perform without love is unprofitable. As without faith no duty profits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. So, without love we cannot profit our Brethren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. Neither can we profit our ſelves. The Apoſtle exhorts that all be done in love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Love edifieth.</hi> Ib. 8.1.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Love makes all other duties honourable to our Brethren. They are beſt entertained of thoſe for whom we do any office of love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>By love we ſhould ſerve one another,</hi> Gal: 5: 13: Love makes a Nurſe very painfull about her childe, you ſhall not have ſo much ſervice from any ſervant you keep as that ſervice a Nurſe performs; ſhe doth it freely and readily, love will make us ſerviceable without meaſure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1 Let us all be ſtirred up to have great reſpect to this great cammande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; If it be a worke of love, it is that which God requires. By love we perform all the commandement of God at once. <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> Whatſoever a man doth without love, it neither profits himſelf nor his brother. Whatſoever duty you performe to any Brother, if you do it not out of love, you will ſoon be weary of it, that is the trueſt hearted duty that is performed in love: avoyd we therefore ſuch occaſions as hinder us from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one another, which is ſometimes ſtrangeneſſe, ſometimes enmity, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times becauſe of the wickedneſſe of others, ſometimes ſelf-love.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt, avoyd ſtrangeneſſe one towards another, God loved us when we were ſtrangers to him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.1. So ought we. Conſider alſo we may be ſtrangers. It's an ill quality in a dog to fly on ſtrangers. It is a <hi>Nabal</hi>-like nature to neglect any office of love to a ſtranger, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We muſt love thoſe that are our enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. Thus did Chriſt, <hi>whileſt we were enemies he dyed for us.</hi> Will a man hate ſuch a member as is painfull to him? No, he will rather labour to heal it. Shall we not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate to thoſe members that make us ſick, or diſquiet us?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We muſt in no wiſe hate thoſe that do evill in Gods ſight or ours, but rather pity them, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14, 15.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth enemy of love to our Brother is ſelf-love; We muſt love our ſelves, but we muſt not determinate our love in our ſelves: When men cannot love others but for themſelves, ſuch men may have a <hi>forme of godlyneſſe but deny the power of it,</hi> 2 Tim. 3, 1, 2, 3, to 5. The greater any cammandement is the more ready we are to break it. But (as we deſire our prayers ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in heaven) ſo let us love one another, and let us do all that we do in love, This will do both our ſelves and others good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Love we our Brethren in obedience to Gods commandement; this muſt be the rule of our love. There are many cankers in love, which this love in obedience to Gods commandment heals.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. All carnall love ſprings from our nature, and ſo we love no farther then ſerves our owne ends, but love in obedience to Gods cammandement is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If our love be not from a commandement it is faithleſſe; now, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not of faith is ſin.</hi> Therefore our love muſt be in obedience to Gods commandement.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is an immoderate love, which is not out of conſcience to God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is a licentious love, which is lawleſſe, but our love muſt be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the commandement of God. We muſt love where, and becauſe God hath commanded us.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:65998:140"/>5 There is an inconſtant love.

This is not according to the rule.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Let us love the Lord our God ſo much the more, becauſe he is carefull to lay this commandement on us, though a ſtranger, an enemy, a wicked man, God cannot endure the rank breath of hatred.</p>

                     <p n="4">4 As if all this had been too little, <hi>he denyed his own life, and laid it downe for us,</hi> John 3.16.</p>

                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> What is the reaſon of this difference, that our love to our neighbour muſt be ſo great above the love to our ſelves.</p>

God hath raiſed up ſome ſooner then others, therefore we muſt take up our faln Brethren.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 God requires love in a more exact manner and meaſure, becauſe he hath now given an higher and more exact pattern. We have the pattern of Chriſt, that forgave us ten thouſand talents, therefore we ought to forgive our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren an hundred pence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</p>

God will come and keep houſe with us, and refreſh and comfort us. If a Chriſtian ſhall grow up in obedience to Chriſt, then Chriſt his Husband will lop off his ſuperfluous branches, that ſo he may bring forth more fruit then he did before; he will comfort us with the conſolations of his holy Spirit, he will come in and ſup with us, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.10. The more comfort, the more ſtrength.

We do not merit any thing at Gods hands by our good works, becauſe we do receive ſtrength from him for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This may ſhew every Chriſtian juſt ground of encouragement to keep himſelf cloſe to Gods commandements, in keeping of them is great reward. For we keep in Chriſt Jeſus, and we keep mutual, and entire, and conſtant fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Father, and ſo we ſhall finde him as an Husband-man taking pains with us, keeping us from evill, and cleanſing us from thoſe corruptions which will make us ſtink in his noſtrils; and this he will do, becauſe he ſees us taking pains, and employing that ſtock of graces which he hath beſtowed on us. By this means God will make our lives comfortable, and will multiply graces in us in a great meaſure, and give us more ſtrentgh to make us yeeld more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto him. And whereas other Chriſtians lives are very obſcure, we ſhall ſhine forth as the Sun at noon day; therefore thoſe Chriſtians much wrong themſelves that think themſelves bound to no commandment, though they would do as God requires, yet they would do it freely, and not as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. But why then doth <hi>John</hi> bid us keep his commandments, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſuch bleſſings to us, if we do keep them? A good man would be doing good duties, though God did not command him, but yet he muſt therefore do good duties, becauſe God commands him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Thoſe Chriſtians are reproved that walk looſely with God, who keep not Gods commandements; as they would keep their way, their jewels, the apple of their eye, their life, ſuch Chriſtians fall ſhort of that great reward which God promiſeth.

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a difference between faith and knowledge: For a man may believe a thing is true, becauſe he doth not doubt of the authority of it, but yet we do not know all truths that are ſpoken, though we believe them, for ſtnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is of a certain concluſion; we know this to be ſo, partly by faith, partly by ſenſe and reaſon; for though faith believe things before we know them, it being the evidence of things not ſeen, and ſo a man may believe that God is gracious before we know it; yet when faith hath laid hold on the promiſes, it ſets reaſon on work. This Spirit of God works in us an evidence of our abode in Chriſt, for 1. this Spirit of God works peace of conſcience, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. which paſſeth all underſtanding; though it doth not always abide, yet it keeps garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon always, it bears witneſſe to a man that Chriſt is in him, and he in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It works a change in all Chriſtians, it changeth them from the power of Satan to the power of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. And though the peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and conſolation of the Spirit abide not always, yet the Spirit of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and ſanctification doth always abide, and doth change the whole man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. Before a carnal and fleſhly Spirit, but now the Spirit of glory and grace reſts upon us, which makes us reliſh Chriſtian communion, and Chriſtian ſociety. This Spirit doth alwayes abide, and ſo we know that Chriſt abides, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>I may think there is a through change, but yet it may be it's only of the outward man?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Conſider how it changeth thy heart. Is thy heart with God, and wholly for God? Doſt thou long for peace with God? Wouldſt thou not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe it if thou hadſt it; for all the world? Is the Word of God more precious to thee then thine appointed food? No profit, pleaſure, or preferment, ſhall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee from following of Chriſt. When a man hath horrour of conſcience, he would give his life for peace, but then a man doth not affect God ſo much as his own peace. Thus <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. When <hi>Saul</hi> had a ſpirit full of trouble, then <hi>David</hi> muſt play a fit of muſick. When wicked mens hearts are at reſt, then they never regard God, but then they cloſe with the world, and ſenſuall luſts. But when the Sun of righteouſneſſe doth ariſe in a mans heart, he will ſcatter abroad all thoſe diſtempers of ſpirit that hang about him, and frame his heart to an holy care of keeping Gods commandements.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To reprove a Popiſh opinion, that no man can know whether Chriſt abide in him or no. But why doth St. <hi>John</hi> then ſay, <hi>Hereby we know?</hi> and he ſpeaks to old men, young men, and babes, to try themſelves. Theſe men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the whole generation of the juſt. Such a woman as cannot tell her child who is his Father, is a ſtrumpet, and ſo is the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. It reproves others that think it impoſſible. Some think it not worth the knowing, others think it not meet to know whether Chriſt abide in them or no; ſuch have no care to make their <hi>calling and election ſure.</hi> But St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 'tis poſſible, and a thing worthy the ſeeking after, and alſo very expedient.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This ſhould exhort all Chriſtians to try and examine themſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are in the faith or no, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Know ye not.</hi> He ſpeaks of ſuch as have lived long under a faithful Miniſtery. It is an evill ſigne; Either know that Chriſt is in you, or be not ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To exhort us to give up our hearts to God, that his fear and love may rule our hearts, that ſo thoſe outward things take not up your affections, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. &amp; 14.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Comfort to Gods ſervants, that give up their hearts and lives to God, which have laid their ſalvation not on a ſandy but ſound ground, which have built it upon divine teſtimony, even the Spirit of God, which is a divine Spirit.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Sometimes the ſpirit of God comes upon a man, as it did on the ſeventy Elders, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.25, 26. The Spirit of God is like the ſpirit of new Wine, which ripens the wits; ſo when the ſpirit of God comes upon a man, he doth better underſtand the Word of God, and the hearts of the people, <hi>The ſpirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.

                     <p n="2">2. There is a ſpirit of the world, which doth not ſhine for the uniting of the hearts of Gods people; but this is a ſpirit of pride, when a man would be counted a learned man; or when a man ſeeks his own profit or honor; the Spirit of God ſeeks <hi>to know the things that are given him of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.12.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is the ſpirit of the Devil, which guides a man into errour in his doctrine, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to our Saviour, <hi>This ſhall not be unto thee;</hi> this ſpirit ſearcheth not the deep things of God, but of the Devil; this ſpirit ſeeks to make the hearts of thoſe ſad, whom he would not have made ſad, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2.13. to 15. to pervert the Scripture, and drive out the care of Gods ſervice, and the power of godlineſſe.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. What was the ſpirit of their diſcipline and government? they did affect primacy; the Apoſtles were no ſooner removed out of the world, but this ſpirit began to ſpring up, yea, while ſome of them lived, <hi>John</hi> 3.9.</p>

Wherefore Miniſters and people ſhould have a ſpeciall care of diſſenſion; for if diſſenſion creep in, then ſoon will you have your worſhip ſhut up, and then there will be a wofull waſt of Religion.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, They are greater in watchfulneſſe, which when it is wanting then they fall; they never want wiſdome and ſtrength, but then it is the fault of Gods ſervants to wax fat, and to kick up the heel againſt God, and to forget the great things he hath done for them; and then though they have their armour about them, yet are they beat back by worldly teachers, and beat almoſt dead, ſo that you ſhall ſcarce ſee them pant: but now at this time, <hi>greater is he that is in them, then he that is in worldly teachers,</hi> for they doe riſe again, and get greater ſtrength, and overcome mightily, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.37, 38. <hi>Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation,</hi> ſo that when we have moſt need of watching and prayer, then we are leaſt able; becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> could not watch with our Saviour, therefore he fell away moſt grievouſly; which ſhews when Gods ſervants put on a careleſſe ſpirit, and doe not make uſe of their wiſdome and ſtrength they have received, they come to be foyled, yet there is a ſeed in them, by which they doe overcome all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yea themſelves alſo. Hence <hi>David</hi> breaks forth into praiſing of the Name of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.1. the people of God are bleſſed with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.19. they ſhall overcome at the laſt, in which reſpect they may well be ſaid to be of his Tribe. How comes a man to overcome
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:65998:149"/>
at his firſt converſion? God puts forth ſuch a mighty arm of watchfulneſſe, wiſdome and ſtrength, as that he overcomes the Devill, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. thus he overcomes the world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>John</hi> 15.19. he is crucified to the world, and the world to him. <hi>He doth then crucifie the fleſh, with the affections and luſts, Gal.</hi> 5.24. ſo that he looks at them all as ignominious and deadly enemies, and if Chriſt ſhews himſelfe thus ſtrong when a man comes on to grow, what will he doe when Chriſtians grow more ſtrong in wiſdome, grace, ſtrength, and watchfulneſſe.</p>
                     <p>

Refutes a popiſh and Arminian conceit, that God chooſeth none to life, but out of foreſeen faith and good works, elſe he had choſen none to life, but this is a mercenary love: let a ſervant labour never ſo hard, yet he knows he ſhall be well paid at the years end; and therefore it is ſervile love, this is that love which they would put upon God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It exhorts all to begin betimes to love God; begin never ſo ſoon, God hath prevented us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. it was an early love of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> at twelve years of age when he ſought after God, but Gods love was up before him; you cannot be in your love before him, though you begin as ſoon as you are warm in the womb, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was very early, when he leaped for joy in the womb, yet Gods love was before him; an Angel had appeared to his Father, and had promiſed a bleſſing, before <hi>John</hi> was begotten.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 To teach old people, if God have prevented them with love long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how ſhould this ſtir them up to love God, and to be humbled for the want of love to God, that hath loved them ſo long? Shall we be to ſeek in our love to God and cleave to worldlineſſe in our old times, and let God ſtay till our children be provided for? What an unworthy dealing is this with God? This ſhould exhort all Gods ſervants that have had experience of Gods love, to acknowledge the freedome of Gods love. <hi>Job</hi> by Gods teſtimony, was a man that feared God and eſchewed evill: What ſaith the Devill, <hi>Doth</hi> Job <hi>ſerve God for naught?</hi> No, but though God had ſtript him of all, as he did, yet he had ſhewed ſuch marvellous love to his ſoul, as that he had juſt cauſe to love God for ever if God ſhould not have beſtowed on him one dram of wealth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 This ſhould teach Gods children, to be as obſervant in love to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as God is to them, to love them freely, to doe kindneſſe to them freely, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2, 3.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Doe you think that ever any man ſerved God for naught? Did <hi>Jobs</hi> care over the poor draw him dry? No, he multiplied it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Comfort to all Gods ſervants that have taſted of this love; he that loves you freely, loves you for ever, becauſe his love ſtands not upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: he that loved us when we were enemies, will he hate us when we are acquainted with him, and reconciled? We ſhall not be worſe then we were before, and if he loved us, becauſe he would love us, his love will for ever remain.</p>

God did not love us, becauſe we were many, but becauſe it pleaſed him to love us: there is a great difference in the death of Chriſt, in reſpect of his own and the wicked; the benefit they have by Chriſts death is this, that they partake of Gods patience and bounty: for the ſame day that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, he and his poſterity ſhould have dyed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.

                     <p>His love is perfect in us, he doth not mean, that love which God hath ſhed abroad in our hearts, for there is no love of God, but is perfect in every man, <hi>but his love is perfect,</hi> that is, that love by which we love God: If our love be not wanting to our brethren, our love is perfect towards God.</p>

                     <p>Perfect, is diverſly taken, ſometimes it is taken for ſound and unfaigned; thus <hi>Amaziah</hi> did not that which was good in the ſight of the Lord, with a perfect heart, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. But <hi>David</hi> and good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did that which was good in the ſight of the Lord, with a perfect heart, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.3. that is, without hypocriſie and rottenneſſe, Let a man profeſſe love to God, and not love to his brother, his love is not true, but hypocritical; but if a man unfeignedly love his brother, he doth ſoundly love God: a man cannot finde God pardoning his ſins, healing his infirmities, but he will love his brethren, and do good offices to them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Perfect is all one with entire, as a childe is then ſaid to be perfect, when he hath all the parts of a man; this perfectneſſe is oppoſed to that which is maimed, ſo his love is perfect, which is entire to God and man: All our duty is to love God, and to love our neighbour as our ſelves, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.21. He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to walk humbly with thy God? that is, to expreſſe thy love to God, and to do juſtice, and love mercy; that is, to our brethren, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8. This is perfection of ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He that loves, fulfills the Law,</hi> the law of the firſt and ſecond Table, and God would have the chiefeſt part of our love to him expreſſed in our love to our brethren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. the chiefeſt of thoſe is love; we do God more honour by faith and hope; but we edifie the Church more by love: ſo that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, as we ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. our love to him to be expreſſed by doing good to the ſons of men, Hence our Saviour will reaſon with the ſons of men at the laſt day, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father.</hi> Matth. 25.34. to the end; ſo that all the love God expects we ſhould ſhew to him, ſhould be poured out to our brethren; if thou be righteous, what doſt thou then give to God? <hi>Job</hi> 35.6, 7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. <hi>I have abounded more then they all,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) by the grace of God,</hi> and that good was by doing many good offices to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; hence God would have all the ſons of men to ſerve him in their general callings, with ſuch graces, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.14. as they may ſhew forth in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular callings in doing all their duties in love, when <hi>David</hi> was earneſt with God for the pardoning of his ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. &amp; <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. and 12.13. ſhewes you; that as he would ſpend himſelf in Gods praiſe, ſo he would labour to bring on others in the ways of grace.</p>

As no member can grow in the body, except it be knit to the body by joynts and ſinews, ſo <hi>Col.</hi> 3.14. in the body of Chriſt love is the bond that knits us together to God and our brethren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 18. and 13.1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 A thing is perfect when it is expert; thus <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.8. ſo is a mans love to God perfect to any good office, a loving Chriſtian is a perfect Chriſtian, you cannot ſet him to any good duty, but he is perfect to it; love oyls the wheels of his affections, and ſets him on that which is helpful to his brethren, and hence it is, that when our Saviour would ſet <hi>Peter</hi> on to feed his lambs, he would lead him on to this work, by propounding this queſtion, whether he loved him or no? <hi>John</hi> 21.15, 16, 17. he preſſed upon him this love; every time he asked him, his love required him to feed his lambs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. The love of Chriſts conſtraineth <hi>Paul</hi> to be ready for doing and ſuffering: A man that goes about a buſineſſe with ill will, he always bungles it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 A thing is then perfect, when it is durable; ſo is it with a mans love, it is durable if it be nouriſhed with love to our brethren; if it make a man ready to be doing good offices to his brethren; this will make it not onely grow and continue, but alſo to abound for ever, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6, 7. If love continue not, the Church will not continue, that is, the whole body of Chriſtians, the body of faithful Miniſters and people; the Church will be removing, if love begin to remove.</p>

If your love be cloſed up from your brethren, then your love is very unſound, or very ſick, ſo much love, ſo much life; and ſo much failing in your ſpiritual love, ſo much failing in your ſpiritual life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.

It exhorts us all not only to the love, but the conſtant love of our brethren, this is the benefit of it, you ſhall have conſtant and abiding fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God; we ſhould not only grow in love, but grow rooted in love, let no grace be ſo eminent in you as love; if God had ſaid he dwels in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, how ſhould it have provoked men to ſtudy for wiſdome; but God doth not ſay he dwels in knowledge, for what then ſhould the ignorant do? He dwels not in honour and riches; for what then ſhould poor men do? But he dwels in ſuch an houſe as the pooreſt may build to God, an houſe of love, therefore above all indowments and gifts of ſoul or body, have a ſpeciall care, to grow rooted in love; a man may have a world of wit, and yet God not dwell in that wit; a man may have abundance of wealth, honours, and beauty, and yet God not in them; but if you ask where God dwels, I anſwer, God dwels in love.</p>
                     <p>There are four places wherein God is ſaid to dwell;
<list>
                           <item>1 In the higheſt holy place.</item>
                           <item>2 In an humble heart, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15.</item>
                           <item>3 Chriſt dwels in our hearts by faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17.</item>
                           <item>4 God dwels in a loving heart; ſo that if you would know where God dwels, it's one of theſe three graces, humility, in faith, or love. How ſhould this provoke us as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>never to give ſleep to our eyes, or ſlumber to our eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids,</hi> till we have built God an habitation of love in our hearts? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.3, 4, 5. Set up a loving heart, and there will God dwell for ever; whereas if your hearts be envious, and hateful and bitter, little doe you know what an evill ſpirit dwels there, and inſtead of comfort, you ſhall find ſuch horrour and anguiſh, that you may plainly diſcern, ſurely God is not in this place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.26. if you ſleep in wrath, the Devil reſts with you.</item>

                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the eſteem the Lord Jeſus bears to ſuch, before whom they are to appear in judgement; for ſuch as love Chriſt and his members, have found Chriſt diſpenſing himſelfe to them, not as a Judge, but as a Saviour, or elſe they could never have loved him nor others; now they that are to meet with a Saviour have cauſe of boldneſſe in that day; or if he come as a Judge, it's but as a Judge to plead their cauſe, and right their wrong, and take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on their enemies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A loving Chriſtian hath a further ground of confidence in his heart, that the day of Chriſts appearing ſhall be as the day of his marriage; now a marriage day is a day of the gladneſſe of the heart, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.10. Now they that love one another are eſpouſed to Chriſt here by their effectuall vocation; but the day of judgement is as the marriage day, Chriſt here adorns and beautifies us, that ſo at the laſt day we may be repreſented as fit Spouſes for himſelfe. Such as are in marriage love, how do they deſire and long after the marriage day? and ſo doe all true Chriſtians, that have kept their hearts chaſt to Chriſt, how doe they pray for the haſtening of that day?

For the handling of this, we may ſee what the Scripture ſpeaks of this torment in the ſeverall deſcriptions and metaphors.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This torment is ſometimes called pricking of conſcience, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. they were pricked at their hearts with fear and ſhame for ſin, though but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before they ſcoft at the Apoſtle, <hi>v.</hi> 13. yet now they were ſtruck with ſuch torments, as they knew not what to doe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Its called a wounding of the ſpirit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. which woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is a larger gaſh then pricking, and ſo implyes more anguiſh, fear and ſhame.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is compared to the ſting of a Scorpion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.5. the Jeſuites doe ſo ſting men with torments of hell and horrour of conſcience, and God gave them not power to heal themſelves again; hence they thought every thing little enough to ſatisfie their conſcience, and ſo they ſuck out their eſtates in building Hoſpitalls, and beſtowing on their Cloyſters.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The wrath of God in the ſoul is compared to venomed arrows, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, This torment is called the rending of the heart, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rend your hearts and not your garments,</hi> the heart and thoughts are ſo rent and diſtracted, that one thing will not hang by another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> calls this, melting of ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.28. as if the heart were like wax, and Gods wrath like burning fire, therefore a man in this caſe is in a bitter eſtate, <hi>Job</hi> 13.26. <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me,</hi> Iſa. 38.15 <hi>I ſhall goe mourning in the bitterneſſe of my ſoul,</hi> for this the ſoul is troubled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. and ſorely vexed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.3.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Why doth a ſoul lying in fear, lye in torment?</hi>

                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Conſider the ſubject of all this fear and torment, and that is the conſcience and heart of man, the judgement and will; the will that before was moſt tough and obſtinate, of all the faculties, theſe torments make, it ſoft, and tender, therefore its ſaid, <hi>Joſiahs heart melted at the hearing of the Law,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.17. <hi>Job</hi> 23.16. the heart is made raw and tender, that look at raw fleſh would be againſt the fire, ſo the tender raw conſcience is anguiſhed with this fire of Gods wrath, according to that old ſaying, He that would goe to heaven muſt ſayl by hell gates.</p>

Even as ſome Sea-men at their firſt voyage, they can pity thoſe that are Sea ſick and toſt, but afterward they grow ſenceleſſe: ſo when Chriſtians firſt lanch out themſelves into this troubleſome condition, they could have pityed others in the like caſe; but through cuſtome men forſake the fear of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: for though commonly theſe fears be ſafe, yet they may end in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair,

                     <p>If the queſtion be, why God loved us? it was not becauſe we had done him any ſervice of love, but he loved us before we loved him. 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>He called us not according to our works, but according to his free purpoſe and grace.</hi> Deut. 7.7, 8. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, becauſe you were more in number then any people, for ye were the feweſt of all people, but becauſe the Lord loved you.</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.4, 5. he loved them becauſe he loved them, and therefore ſurely without prevention or deſert on our parts.</p>

From the removal of ſuch cauſes of love, as might prevent God on our parts, if there be any cauſe on our parts, he loved us either out of foreſeen faith or good works; but from neither of theſe; not from foreſeen faith, for it's the love of God to us that produceth faith. Acts 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life believed,</hi> ſo that our faith ſpringeth from Gods love, chooſing us to life; nor for our good works, for we are his workmanſhip, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in Chriſt Jeſus to good works, ſo that good works did not cauſe Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining us to life, but Gods ordaining us to life cauſeth good works, ſo that faith and good works are not cauſes, but fruits of Gods love to us.</p>

Je. 31.3. <hi>I have loved you with an everlaſting love.</hi> Now if Gods love be eternal before the world was, then it was not for our ſakes, who were made after, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. Nothing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral can be the cauſe of that which is eternal, our love and faith began in time, his love was eternal.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>Though our love and faith began but now, yet he fore-ſaw it from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore it might move him to ſet his love on us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's all one with God, whether you have reſpect to that which is now, or what he knows will be hereafter, ſo a wiſe man ſerves a Prince, not out of meer affection to the Prince, but becauſe he loved himſelfe firſt; for he fore-ſaw if he ſerved him carefully, he ſhould have abundant recompence: Now to the wiſe man it's all one, whether he have reſpect to the future fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen recompence, or to the preſent, and therefore ſtill his ſervice is merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; therefore when God loved us, it was not for any thing we did, or was

foreſeen to be done by us, for then we had not <hi>loved him, becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> but he had loved us, becauſe we firſt loved him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In Scripture account, that which comes after, is not the cauſe of that which went before, therefore our love coming after cannot be the cauſe of Gods love going before: To <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed were the promiſes made, not by works or obedience to the Law, for the Law was given four hundred years after, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. and therefore God had not reſpect to it, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle argues; So that which we have done four thouſand years after the world was made, cannot be the cauſe of Gods love before the world was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.12, 13, 14. If the Apoſtle there had not excluded foreſeen works, his arguing had been of no effect; for he ſpeaks not onely of what was then, but hee conſidered nothing that might be afterwards as the cauſe of his love.</p>

To refute thoſe that make Gods love to us depend upon our love to him, they expreſly blot out this Scripture, to ſay that any one is beloved of God for his fore-ſeen faith, is to ſay, that God loved us, becauſe we firſt loved him, which is expreſly contrary to this Text, ſo that if we enquire the cauſe of Gods love to us, we muſt ſeek it in God, not in our ſelves, for he loved us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loved us.</p>

Why, God is the ancienteſt that ever thou hadſt, he loved thee before thou wert, before thou kneweſt what the world was, or what love was, therefore love him again.</p>

Of conſolation to ſuch as have experience of Gods love towards them, if God loved us before we loved him, when we were ſtrangers and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then ſurely he will not caſt us off for our infirmities in our after loves, it may be we may be looſe and ſinful; but God loved us at firſt, not for our goodneſſe, neither will he caſt us off afterward for our wickedneſſe. Yet this is no encouragement to licentiouſneſſe, for God knows how to put us to angui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes and ſtraights, and croſſes, and yet reſerve everlaſting life for us. There is never a ſervant of God, but had he caſt him off for his failings, he had never been ſaved, none but have failed in many things, and abuſed Gods grace; but God knows how to heal ſuch diſtempers, and yet reſerve his mercy to us; if he began to love us, before we loved him, then as he was firſt in love, ſo he will be laſt.</p>

If therefore there be a different ſpirit in us, we are not of the ſame ſpirit, work not by the ſame Spirit. In a naturall body, if a member be cut off in a combate, in our hot blood we miſſe it not, nor feel the pain, but in cold blood we find the miſſe of it, and ſeek out for help; ſo in hot contentions betwixt Chriſtians they fall off from one another, they diſcern no change for the preſent; but when they begin to look back at former paſſages, and ſee what wounds they have made, both joyntly begin to be ſenſible of pains, and cannot reſt till they have taken ſome courſe to ſet the members in joynt again.</p>

Now he will endure touching any where elſe rather then on the apple of his eye. God knows that mens goodneſſe extends not to him, ſo neither doth their hatred; if we be wicked and injurious; what harm can we doe to him? Why, God will bear much longer Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſwearing, and other groſſe ſins, then injuries put upon his people: how long did God endure the heathen Monarchs, till they fell ſore upon the Church? the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtate flouriſhed exceedingly above ſeven hundred years; though their Capital was filled with all manner of Gods, but the times of this ignorance God regarded not, but followed them with great Victories and deſignes, and there were many worthy men among them for valour and prudence; but when the Emperours grew hot againſt the Chriſtians, and perſecuted them, God would endure them no longer, but tumbled their Monarchy into the duſt: <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and doe my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

no harm.</hi> Some man will endure much more injury againſt himſelfe, then againſt his children; ſo while the world treſpaſſeth againſt God himſelf, by Idolatry, Superſtition, or prophaneneſſe, he ſits ſilent as if he regarded them not: but when they wax fierce againſt the Church, then he ariſeth like a mighty Gyant, and raiſeth his forces, even ſuch plagues as the world rings of, as thoſe ten plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> witneſſe; and all this ariſeth from his tenderneſs over them, becauſe their afflictions may doe them more harm then they can doe him, as long as the Church keeps any good termes with him, no man is more tender of his Spouſe, no father of his child, then God is of his Church.</p>

From the care God takes of the preſervation of love unfeigned to himſelfe; why, that it may be preſerved ſpotleſſe, God will ſtill keep in us a diligent care of love to our brethren; for next after hypocriſie, nothing more odious to God then Apoſtacy, and more dangerous to us, as being the way to the ſin againſt the holy ghoſt: Now ſo long as a man walks in love, and keeps a conſtant fellowſhip with the Saints, ſo long we keep a conſtant fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God himſelfe; but let a man faile in his love to his brethren, he falls off from God, and ſo runs into grievous Apoſtacy againſt God to the ſpighting of the holy ghoſt; therefore as you would put honour on God, and maintain his Spirit in you, ſo take heed you neglect not brotherly love; if we neglect this, we are in rhe way to total Apoſtacy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. From the delight God takes that all his ſervants ſhould wear his livery, and be known to be his Diſciples: now if God had only left us to faith in Chriſt, to calling on his Name, all this might have been and yet we never been known what we were; but becauſe God would have it known thar there is a generation of men calling upon his name, and ſerving him in truth, he would never have them come abroad without this cognizance to their brethren, and by this mark all men ſhould know ye are my Diſciples, if you love one another, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.35. therefore if a man throws away brotherly love, he throws away the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, he is no Chriſtian, therefore offer not to ſay, thou loveſt God, or love thy brother alſo.</p>

Faith looks to the promiſe for ſtrength, when he goes about any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty, he goes not about it in his own ſtrength, but he derives ſtrength from Chriſt, Without me ye can doe nothing, from him is thy fruit found, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8, 9. he relies on the promiſe for help, for comfort, for acceptance, he doth all in the name of Chriſt, that is, in his life and power, and looks for acceptance in the name of Chriſt onely.</p>

But the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a faith that fleſh and bloud cannot attain unto; therefore that which they call Catholique faith, to believe thoſe Doctrines <hi>mala fide</hi> propounded by their Church is a fiction; the Devill believes better then they, he believes the word of God to be true: but to believe this to be true by a true and lively faith, is ſuch a beliefe, as whereby we are born of God.</p>

faith. Contrary, if a man ſay he believes in Chriſt, and yet makes no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to live according to Gods commandements, relies not on him for ſtrength in his performances, is not patient under his hand, ſuch a beliefe as this, is far from that which the Text ſpeaks of.</p>

To believe on Chriſt, and not to make uſe of him, is to ſay, we believe in him, and yet believe him not. If thou were told, that in ſuch a corner of a field there lay abundance of treaſure, and yet thou liveſt in penury and want, and never goeſt about to dig it up, every man would think thou wert not perſwaded of the truth of it, but that thou lookeſt at it as a fable. So for a man to ſay that he believes on Chriſt, and yet to let Chriſt lie by him, as a refuſed commodity, and never look to him for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and help, who will believe that we are perſwaded that Jeſus is the Chriſt the anointed of God?</p>

Of conſolation to every believing ſoul, we are ready to call in queſtion our regeneration and adoption, why if God gives us hearts believing that Jeſus is the Chriſt, and therefore thou goeſt about to dig up this treaſure in him, and therefore art reſolved not to leave off till thou haſt found him, and truſteſt upon him daily for help and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, dependeſt on him, ſeekeſt him with all thy heart: Why, be of good comfort, thy faith is a ſufficient teſtimony to thee, that thou art born of God.</p>

                     <p>This Chriſt teacheth his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 15.14. <hi>Then are ye my friends, if ye doe whatſoever I command you.</hi> Now friendſhip argues integrity of love. Now betwixt friends there paſſeth a mutuall covenant, a mutuall communication of good one to another, and of ſecrets; ſo there is a certain community of all things, all things are common among friends: So, he that keeps Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, looks at Gods law, ſo as he makes it of his counſell and delight, and is ruled by it. And again, God communicates his attributes to him, which is ſomething more then a parent doth to his childe, though he love him well, yet he will not communicate to him whatſoever is his, nor alwayes make him of his counſell, nor yet ſhew familiarity towards him; but God looks at Chriſtians as his friends, communicates his counſells to them, grows in acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>Its not for friends to be at command, but ſervants. Its a point of ſervice, and not of friendſhip.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To doe it as a duty of neceſſity, is a ſervants condition; but to do a thing for loves ſake to his friend, this is an act of friendſhip. Further, a man is not ſaid to keep the Commandements, when himſelf onely ſtrives to keep them, but when he draws others to the ſame conſcionable obedience. Friends have all things common, and they doe not love that any that belong to them, ſhould be enemies to their friends: So God looks at it as a part of <hi>Abrahams</hi> friendſhip, that he would command his children and ſervants after him, that they ſhould keep the way of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.17, 19. Hence in Scripture its a ſpirituall ſtyle give to <hi>Abraham, Abraham the friend of God, James</hi> 2.23. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.8. Now, what eminent ſervice did he above others? There were others as zealous as he, but this he had eminent in him, <hi>I know he will teach his children and houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold to keep my wayes.</hi> Look at <hi>Moſes, David, Eli, Jehoſaphat,</hi> all godly men, yet they were all failing in this, in inſtructing and bringing on their children and ſervants to the fear of God; but this was <hi>Abrahams</hi> friendſhip, that he was not onely carefull himſelfe, but he ſought to bring on his whole family to Gods worſhip. We ſee his care about <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that God would eſtabliſh his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.18. And about <hi>Iſhamael,</hi> that he might live in thy ſight; and he brought on his whole family to be circumciſed, though a painfull thing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>ult.</hi> This was a fruit of true love. So <hi>David.</hi> profeſſeth in his own perſon and Chriſts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>O Lord I delight in thy Law.</hi> Pſ 19.9, 10. <hi>Thy commandements are more precious then gold, yea then fine gold: thy precepts are ſweeter then honey and the honey-comb.</hi> A ſigne they were not grievous to him. Love makes us delight in the thing beloved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What is the reaſon that this is ſuch an undoubted argument of our love to God?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the ſtrictneſſe and purity of Gods law, and the croſneſſe of it to our nature. <hi>The weapons of our warfare are mighty to bring down every high thought,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. Here two contraries meet together; the prerogative of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:65998:179"/>
God he will have our thoughts brought into ſubjection; and the liberty of the Creature, We will not have our thoughts and tongues bound, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.4. We are free born, we are ſervants to none. Now theſe being ſo croſſe one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for a man now not onely to doe Gods commandements, but to doe them willingly, and out of love; why, this is ſuch a yoke, that were it not for the mighty power of Gods love prevailing in our hearts, which conſtrains us to doe it moſt willingly, which nature is moſt unwilling unto, it would never be wrought. Hence Gods people are ſaid to be a <hi>willing people,</hi> Pſal. 110. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is a <hi>Spirit of liberty,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. Its evident Gods Spirit is there where we doe Gods commandements with freedome and willingneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From the experience ſuch have had of the burthen of ſin, to whom Gods commandements ſeem eaſie: For this is certain, the more welcome ſin, the more unwelcome Gods commandements; the more we delight in ſin, the leſſe we delight in Gods commandements; but when once ſin is weariſome to a ſoul, to them <hi>Chriſts yoke is eaſie, and his burthen light,</hi> Mat. 11.28, 29.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From the unſufficiency of any eſtate but an eſtate of love, to reach to the obedience of Gods commandements, much leſſe to the eaſineſſe thereof. A man by nature is not <hi>ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi> Rom. 8.7, 8. And though by common gifts we may be brought to doe much, as <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> did, yet unleſſe there be ſoundneſſe of love within, you ſhall never prevail with <hi>Jehu</hi> to caſt out the golden calves, or with <hi>Herod</hi> to put away <hi>Herodias.</hi> It muſt be the love of God within that muſt bring us to keep his commandements, or at leaſt to doe them willingly and heartily.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. A ground of tryall of our eſtates, whether we love God or no. If we would be aſſured of this, as we all had need to be, conſider of this, Doſt thou keep Gods commandments as thy way, thy jewels, the apple of thy eye, thy life? And, doſt thou deſire to bring all thy children and family to the like conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obedience, that all thy family may be Gods friends? This is an argument of thy unfained love to God. And if withall this ſeem eaſie to thee, &amp; thou delight in it, and thinkeſt it thy happines, that every thought in thee may be ſubject to Chriſt; this is a ſufficient teſtimony of the ſincerity of thy love. But, <hi>è contra,</hi> if we ſhake off Gods yoke, and we will have our thoughts and tongues at liberty, if it be a grief to us to ſee any of our friends conſcionable of Gods worſhip or of religion; why, thou art none of Gods friend. For if thou wert, thou wouldſt deſire that both thy ſelfe and all thy friends were Chriſts friends. If a man loved his Maſter, and liked his ſervice well, and deſired to ſtay with him, he would have his ear bored, that ſo all his Maſters commandements might ſink the better into him; why, this muſt needs argue great love to his Maſter. This <hi>David</hi> alludes to, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6. <hi>Mine ears haſt thou bored,</hi> or as it is in the Originall, <hi>digged.</hi> He digged through all obſtructions, and made him willing to liſten to Gods will; a loving Servant becomes a friend: So, if we might have liberty to get looſe from God, yet if we had rather abide in his ſervice, let us give our ears to God to be bored, and give up not onely our ſelves but our whole family to be Gods bond-ſervants.</p>

Indeed, in themſelves the comforts of the world are good and uſefull but as far as they have a ſnare in them, he overcomes them, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.4.

                     <p>Now, how doth a regenerate Chriſtian overcome this?</p>
                     <p n="1">1 He abideth conſtant in his Chriſtian courſe, notwithſtanding the flattering or threatning of the world, ſo that he will not be ſeduced by any of theſe ſnares, Eph. 6.11, 13. <hi>Paul</hi> would not give place to ſuch ſeducements; no, not for an hour: Now, that is a part of a mans victory, to hold his owne, and to keep his ſtanding, and not to flit; ſuch a man is never ſaid to be overcome that keeps his ſtanding.</p>

This is to overcome a temptation, to take a ſpoyl, to enrich our ſelves by the ſpoyl of our enemies, that is ſuch a conqueſt as the Apoſtle calls <hi>more then a conqueſt,</hi> Rom. 8.37. <hi>In all this we do more then conquer.</hi> For a conqueror gets a victory ſometimes, but with much wounds and loſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſometimes with no loſſe. 2 After victories they grow Inxurious.

                     <p>But a godly man ſo overcomes and divides the ſpoyl that he ſpoyls not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

But yet, though a true Chriſtian be led captive by the world, ſo as he hath little skill in any thing elſe but worldly matters; full of dexterity in the world, and but a bungler in grace; yet if a man be born of God, the Spirit of God at length will let him ſee his error, and then be will mourn for it, and oppoſe and reſiſt to the death. As a childe getting into a boat, at length the wind riſeth, and carryeth the boat from the ſhoar, and toſſes him in the deep, he is not able to uſe the oares to bring him to the ſhoar, but after much toyling he is drowned, and a puffe of wind, or the return of the floud, caſts him on the ſhoar dead: So, many times a Chriſtian falls a tampering with the world, and it pleaſeth him well, till at length the world heaves and carries him up, untill he be carryed into the main, plunged ſo deep in the world, that he ſees he hath loſt his love to God, and then he ſtrives to recover himſelfe, and labours and goes mourning to his

Again, there are many diſcomforts and dangers, which are enemies to grace. Now, to him that hath overcome theſe, the yoke of Gods commandements is eaſie. <hi>Paul</hi> to whom the world was crucified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. when he hears that bonds and afflictions attend him. he cares for none of theſe things, he can fulfill his courſe with joy for all theſe, then ſurely his task is not a grievous yoke, but joyfull.</p>

                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the weapons that the world lends Satan in every tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whatſoever temptation comes from Sotan, or from our own corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they finde no argument to perſwade us, but only taken from the world; ſo that if once you have overcome the world, no temptation will lay hold on you. There have been many that have been willing to partake of Chriſt, but when Chriſt hath bid them part with all, they went away ſorrowful. Mat. 10.22. Here was a loſſe of profit kept him off. Some are kept off by profits, ſome by pleaſures, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18, 19, 20. The profits of the world made <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> diſſemble, the love of the world made <hi>Demas</hi> forſake <hi>Paul.</hi> What made <hi>Achitophel</hi> hang himſelf, but diſgrace of the world? For eaſe ſake <hi>Judas</hi> hanged himſelfe: So ſome mens credit and honors keep them off, <hi>John</hi> 5.44. How can ye believe that receive honour one of another? The ſeeking of worldly honour and glory, hinders them from ſeeking Gods glory, <hi>John</hi> 12.42, 43. All the diſcouragements that hinder in our Chriſtian courſe, are either from the profits, pleaſures, or honors of the world. If therefore we have got victory over the world, then no temptation ſhall make us think Gods yoke grievous. What made <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> and others think Gods commandements heavy but their profits and pleaſures?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. May ſerve to teach thoſe that would walk on in a Chriſtian courſe with freedome and liberty, to wean their affections from the love of the world. Bear a crucified affection to the contents of the world, and then Gods yoke will not ſeem heavy.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Though the commandements be great and heavy, yet as a man is, ſo is his ſtrength. When a man hath got victory over the world, hee hath got Chriſt in his ſoul, and ſo through the ſtrength of Chriſt he is able to prevail, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.4. And withall, there abides with him the mighty power of Gods Spirit, and Gods Word, which affords him mighty ſtrength.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a weakning of the enemy. All the weapons that Satan uſeth are took away when a man hath once overcome the world: were a man advanced to the ſtars, he would ſee the ſtars to be huge immenſe things, far above that they ſeem now, and he would look at the earth as a ſmall point. But if we ſtand here below, we look at the earth as a great thing. We think worldly honors and preferments great dignities, and the ſtars we think them ſmall things, becauſe we ſtand below, and are renewed from them; but in caſe God lift us above the world, and we might have our eyes enlightened to ſee the greatneſſe of Gods favour, and Chriſts blood, and heavenly things; why, then thoſe earthly things would ſeem ſmall. If we would therefore walk in an enlarged frame, let us eſteem earthly things as ſmall matters, worth little regard, and account heavenly things as worthy your higheſt eſteem, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be looked at.</p>

                     <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> had made that profeſſion of his faith, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt the Son of the living God;</hi> what ſaith Chriſt to this? <hi>Bleſſed art thou Simon, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 16.16, 17, 18. This confeſſion made <hi>Simon</hi> to be a rock, and upon this rock of <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion, Chriſt built his Church: So that, if you ask upon what foundation the Church ſtands, it was upon this faith, and againſt this faith the gates of hell, and all the judiciall power thereof ſhall not prevail.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What is it then to believe that Jeſus is the Son of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1 He that believes that that Jeſus whom <hi>Judas</hi> betrayed, and the <hi>Jews</hi> crucified, is the Son of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 He that believes that he is the Son of God in whom he is <hi>well pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3.17. So that he is that mighty power and wiſdome of God, in whom his Father is well pleaſed. This faith overcomes the world.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Becauſe this kind of faith cannot be attained by any humane means, but by an heavenly revelation from God the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16. And in that age when St. <hi>John</hi> wrote this, there was no humane reaſon to induce us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 All antiquity of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was againſt it. They had heard of <hi>Jupiter Apollo</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſeemed a new God to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.18.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 All authority was againſt it, 2 Cor. 2.8. None of the Princes of the world knew of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The univerſall conſent of all the habitable world was againſt it, ſave one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſmal handful of people that believed him to be the Chriſt, the Son of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 There was ſomething in reaſon founded againſt it, for a man to look for ſalvation from a poor Carpenters Son, from a deſpiſed man; one that was excommunicated, and crucified, and could not ſave himſelf; for a man to look for ſalvation from him, was more then fleſh and blood could reach; for the poor thief upon the Croſſe, to ſee him on the Croſſe, and yet to beg of him a Kingdome, and after death too, this was ſuch a faith as overcame the world. This fleſh revealed not, to take a man at the worſt, and then to believe on him for ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But now who is there that believes not Jeſus to be the Son of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis true. We have now all thoſe arguments to prove him to be the Son of God, which they wanted. We have the antiquity of many hundred years, we have authority on our parts, and the univerſall conſent of the whole Chriſtian world hath now taken up ſuch a principle; and for reaſons, we have reaſon enough, ſeeing ſo many ages, ſo many wiſe and great men conſent to this truth. And therefore it's now leſſe wonder to believe Jeſus to be the Son of God. What then? Is St. <hi>Johns</hi> argument of no force now?</p>
                     <p>Yes certainly, therefore 2 we ſay, It's no great matter to believe Jeſus to be the Son of God, upon humane credulity of antiquity, univerſality, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon. That's not the faith that overcomes the world; but it muſt be ſuch a faith as is wrought in our hearts by God himſelfe, and this faith far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from humane credulity.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 No man that believes Chriſt to be the Son of God by this divine faith, but looks up to him for ſalvation. <hi>Look unto me and be ſaved all ye ends of the earth,</hi> Iſa. 45.22.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 From the mighty power and virtue a faithfull ſoul derives from Chriſt to overcome the world: when you look at all the world, and all the comforts thereof, and compare them with Chriſt, you ſhall find them ſo vain and empty, that there is no compariſon, Pſalm. 73.25. Mat. 16.24. What is there in the world that would be equal with Chriſt? Did not <hi>Moſes</hi> on this ground deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe all the treaſures and pleaſures of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> because he had ſeen him that was in the buſh? Heb. 11.27.

For if this faith overcome the world, then it will overcome Satan and the corrupt luſts of thine owne heart, and therefore this faith cannot be overcome, but is ſecure againſt all enemies. If it were poſſible that our faith could be extinguiſhed then this were not true, that <hi>Faith overcomes the world.</hi> If a man therefore loſe his faith; ſuch faith was never true.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It teacheth us the exceeding danger of the love of the world. How many are there that riſe early and ſit up late, that ſpend their whole care and pains to get worldly wealth? Why, do you think this a ſafe condition? Would you not think him an infidel, that would not believe that Jeſus is the Son of God. If a man be overcome of the world, truly he believes it not, that Jeſus is the Son of God and can ſuch a man be a Chriſtian?</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>What ſay you? Were there never any good men overcome of the world? What ſay you to thoſe that recanted in Q. Mary's dayes for fear, and after repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and were burnt for their profeſſion? What ſay you to Peter?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> A godly man in a combate may be overthrown, yet not overcome; as it is in wreſtling, a man may get the foyl, and yet afterwards riſe up and get the victory, ſo oft-times a foyled Souldier gets the day. So <hi>Peter</hi> though he were foyled at that day, and yet when he got up again, and afterward was charged not to preach in the Name of Jeſus, he overcame all. <hi>Whether it be meet to obey God or man, judge ye,</hi> Acts 4.19. Indeed, if a man be thrown down, and there he lyes, and takes no care to get up again, look at him as no true believer; therefore look not at theſe as things that may ſtand together, to ſerve God and man, and the world too. So reſpect the world, as that you ever look at Chriſt to have incomparably more worth then all the world, and let your chiefeſt love and endeavour be towards him.</p>

Why, you may aſſure your ſelves that the world ſhall never overcome you. Look up to him as your Saviour, for your ſalvation; Look ſo on him as to mourn for your ſins, and obey him as the eternal Son of God. Keep this faith in exerciſe, and you ſhall not be overthrowne; or if you be, it will ſo raiſe you up, and recover you, that you ſhall overcome at the laſt.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 That by his blood and ſufferings he might purchaſe out of his Fathers wrath, a Church unto himſelf, Acts 20 28. And by that blood, not onely the elect, but all the creatures are purchaſed, at leaſt to be ſerviceable to the Church. Chriſt bath bought all things quick and dead, either for his Churches comfort or affliction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>All power in heaven and earth is given into his hand,</hi> Pſal. 2.8.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That he might make at onement for our ſouls. It was impoſſible that the blood of Buls and Goats ſhould expiate for our ſins, but as they look at <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his blood is given to be an atonement for our ſins, Heb. 9.12, 13.

                  <p>For 1. the Spirit breathing in the Scripture, is one of the chiefeſt teſtimonies, that is born to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. and therefore this witneſſe may not be omitted.</p>

Now then the Spirit breathing in the Apoſtles, though their outward man was baſe and weak, yet their words were mighty and powerfull, and even as Chriſt was moſt full of power, when he was moſt deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

                        <pb n="362" facs="tcp:65998:184"/>1. There is a mighty power therein to convince men of their ſinfull eſtate, and of their need of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 16, 8, 9.</p>

                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>Secondly, In the Scripture there is a Spirit of perfection, whereby the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed to every good work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. There is no calling but a man may finde abundant directions for it in the Scripture: the Heathen Moraliſts have written concerning our carriages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, but little towards God; ſo the laws of men, a man may fulfill them all, and yet live an hypocrite, and die a reprobate, which ſhews their imperfection, and therefore mens laws are often changed and altered: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man find ſuch a word, as that when he underſtands it, he finds ſufficient directions to lead him in all his wayes, and bring him to Heaven: this ſhews the divine perfection of the Scripture, that what once it delivers that is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect, and this Spirit bears witneſſe to it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Spirit bears witneſſe to Chriſt, as it breaths in our hearts, for though the Spirit ſhould breath never ſo ſtrongly, yet if we have not the evidence of it in our hearts, we ſhall not know the truth of ſuch a thing: Now the Spirit breathing in our conſciences is a Spirit of peace and purity, both ſpringing from Chriſt; the Spirit of peace perſwades our conſciences of the vertue and power of Chriſts bloud, had it not been for Chriſts bloud, we ſhould never have had peace, but have been like <hi>Cain</hi> living in <hi>Nod,</hi> in continuall agitation; but Chriſts bloud ſpeaks peace.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As he came by bloud, ſo he came by water, and this is witneſſed by the Spirit of Sanctification, and there is in this Spirit a threefold work ſutable to this water.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. As ſpringing water waſhes and cleanſes along as it goes, ſo doth the Spirit of God waſh us with clean water, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. unleſſe it be troubled with ſome obſtructions, which yet it will overgrow and run clear.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As water hath a power to make trees fructifie about it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. ſo the water of life gives a Chriſtian ſuch ſupplying ſtrength unto his heart, that it makes him ſtrong and fruitfull, that whatſoever God or man requires, he in ſome good meaſure is inabled to perform it: ſo that a Chriſtian ſoule by this Spirit breathing in him, can plainly diſcern that Chriſt <hi>came by water and bloud.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. Hence learn, that all that believe this divine teſtimony of the Son, ought to be compounded into unity; it was the laſt ſolemn Prayer that Chriſt put up for the Church, that they all might be one with him, as he was one with the Father, <hi>John</hi> 17.8, 9, 20, 21. where he uſeth this as a motive to God, to bring on all believers to unity, becauſe he was one with the Father, and the Father with him, and therefore he prayes that they be one, that hereby the world might believe that God had ſent him; as if diſſenſions among brethren would bear witneſſe to the world, that God did not ſend his Son to be our Saviour; ſo that by theſe diſſenſions, as much as in them lies, they make the promiſes of God of none effect.</p>

And indeed all the diſſenſions of the world have ſprung from this ground, that they doe not all worſhip one God, or believe not that God is but one: For what makes a man to fall out with his brother, but either his profit, or pleaſure, or credit is conceived to be hindered, and is not this becauſe I make my profit, or my credit my God? and ſo I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe God, and fellowſhip with his Saints, then loſe any gain and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſo I am a lover of pleaſure more then of God: Now the Apoſtle made account, if we profeſſe but one God, the unity of God ſhould be more powerfull to make us one, then any thing in the world ſhould be to make us two: ſo much diſſenſion, ſo much atheiſm: If we ſuffer the world to be more mighty to make difference then God to make unity, we make God our Idoll.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, There is in the Scripture a Spirit of perfection, ſo that if we have but the teſtimony of the Scripture, what need we any further witneſſe? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is a Spirit that bears witneſſe in our hearts, <hi>that Jeſus is the Son of God,</hi> and that Spirit is the ſame that breathed in the Scripture, ſo that when we are hearing, or reading, yet the Spirit ſets it home to your hearts and ſouls, ſo that we goe home either convinced, or comforted, or ſtrengthned to every good work and duty God requires; now this Spirit fully perſwades us, <hi>that Jeſus is the Son of God;</hi> for this Spirit goes beyond the power of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things; for no created power is able to convince an hard heart, or comfort a dejected Spirit, or ſtrengthen us in our Chriſtian courſe, therefore if we find a Spirit in us, inabling us to doe all this, the ſoul reſts ſatisfied without any need of further witneſſe, <hi>that Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, Water bears witneſſe to this; by water ſome underſtand the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of baptiſm, and indeed that gives ſtrong teſtimony to Chriſt, eſpecially to them that are prepared to receive it: as in the Apoſtles times, when they were firſt brought on to believe, and then to be baptized, God then ſtrongly teſtified this truth, ſo that after baptiſm, they were filled with much joy, and oft-times with divers gifts and tongues, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.36. The water of baptiſm ſent away the Eunuch rejoycing, ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6, 7. and though children be not capable of this mercy now in their Infancy, except by an extraordinary power, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a Chriſtian afterwards findes ſuch vertue and ſtrength from his baptiſm, that he ſees there is no water like it, but that there is a divine teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in it: But becauſe water is but a repreſentation of this Spirit, therefore by water here, may be underſtood the water of ſanctification, the Spirit of God ſanctifying and regenerating us; for beſides the Spirit of God, that at ſome extraordinary times fills with unſpeakable joy of the holy Ghoſt; there is alſo an ordinary work of Gods Spirit, partly cooling, refreſhing us, as water doth, partly making us fruitful in our Chriſtian courſe; for thoſe great inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gods Spirit, doe not always abide with us in that meaſure, but this water is a ſpring in us, continually afording us ſomething which evidently wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth this truth, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>John</hi> 4.14.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In this water of Gods Spirit, we finde a power to cleanſe us from our luſts, as running waters doe channells and ſinks, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. when I ſee ſomething in me conforming me to Chriſt, that water bears witneſſe, <hi>that Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a power in water to cool and refreſh us, when God ſheds abroad his Spirit in us, there is ſomething that cools us from the heat of Gods wrath, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This water is of a mighty power to make us fruitfull, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian watered by the Spirit of God, draws ſuch moyſture and life from every Ordinance of God, that he brings forth fruit in due ſeaſon, according to his calling, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 30.26, 27.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How doth this water bear witneſſe that Jeſus is the Son of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe all the vertue that this water hath to cleanſe, comfort, or fructifie us, ſprings onely from faith in the teſtimony, <hi>that Jeſus is the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.19, 20. Let Chriſtians obſerve, when we walk in the ſtrength
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65998:187"/>
of our own ſpirits and graces, we ſhall grow ſo dry and barren, that not one good fruit comes from us, and this is becauſe we ſuck from our owne graces, and ſo ſpend on the ſtock, and ſo ſoon draw our ſelves dry, for want of living by faith in the Son of God; but a Chriſtian that hath the water of Sanctification, let him doe all in the Name of Chriſt, and ſuck life from him daily, and he ſhall be ſufficiently inabled to every duty that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; we never found this water, till we believed on Chriſt, and this water no longer runs freſh and full, then we renew our dayly dependence on him, and if we did ſo dayly, we ſhould alwayes find it full Sea in our hearts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Bloud is a third witneſſe on earth, and that is the bloud of his ſufferings that doth bear witneſſe to our ſouls, <hi>that Jeſus is the Son of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it bears witneſſe to us, 1. by pacifying our conſcience, Heb. 12.24. There is a louder cry in the bloud of Chriſt to pacifie our ſouls, then in the guilt of ſin to bring wrath upon us, and this is ſo lively a teſtimony, that a Chriſtian knows, were it not for the bloud of Chriſt, all the things in the world would not have quieted his conſcience.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The bloud of Chriſt, purchaſeth us to become his, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. Now when we can find our ſelves the purchaſed ones of God, the peculiar people of God, this bloud of purchaſe witneſſeth, that it was the Son of God that redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us from the world and our own corrupt hearts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The ſame bloud doth therefore bear witneſſe, <hi>that Jeſus is the Son of God,</hi> becauſe it's a bloud of purity, ſprinkled upon every Ordinance and creature, every thing was purified by bloud, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19. to 23. this bloud of Chriſt on every thing makes it pure, <hi>To the pure all things are pure,</hi> ſo that to ſuch a one, his calling and company, his meat and drink doe not inſnare him, as they doe other men, ſet further off from God, but by this bloud it is, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, that we are made more fruitful and ſerviceable to God, yea were it not for the bloud of Chriſt, our very graces would corrupt us, it's the bloud of Chriſt that makes them all uſefull and ſavory, and turn to our good.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 That the Father, Son, and Spirit, are divine witneſſes, is no queſtion, for they are the three Perſons in the Trinity, and yet are but one God, Deut. 6 4. Therefore their teſtimony muſt needs be divine. But the queſtion is, <hi>How doe theſe hear witneſſe in our hearts to this truth, he that believeth hath all theſe witneſſes in himſelfe?</hi>

                     <p n="1">1 The Father, as he is the Fountain of the God head, ſo his work is a work of Almighty power, and that is it which ſpeaks in the heart of every believer, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me; except the Father which ſent me draw him:</hi> as none come to Chriſt, <hi>except the Father draw him;</hi> ſo he draws none, but by the ſame power whereby he ſent Chriſt, and that was by his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign authority; if God ſhould draw us onely by the cords of men, we ſhould break through all, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. But when God ſhakes our hearts by an Almighty power, and lets us ſee the danger of our eſtate, and after enlightens us to ſee the wayes of ſalvation, then he draws a man on to Chriſt: take a naturall man, all the world cannot perſwade him of his dangerous eſtate, but he is perſwaded of his good nature and good heart towards God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If he be convinced of it, all the world cannot perſwade him, that any promiſe belongs to him, and therefore here God muſt put forth an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power of a Spirit of adoption, whereby he is brought on to believe the promiſes; before he had onely an humane credulity, now he believes it from a teſtimony within himſelfe, <hi>John</hi> 6.45.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 The Spirit bears witneſſe to our hearts of this truth, by convincing our hearts of it, <hi>John</hi> 16.9.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By working a Spirit of faith, and a ſpirit of joy in believing, <hi>John</hi> 14.16, 17. Hence he is called <hi>the Comforter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By giving us a ſpirit to make us overcome the temptations of the world, and the luſts of our own hearts, 2 Tim. 1.7. 1 John 4.4. and this teſtimony is divine.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 <hi>The Spirit,</hi> that is, the Spirit breathing in the Word hath ſuch a mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to enlighten, and quicken, and ſtrengthen a ſoul, that whatſoever the Spirit ſpeaks in the Scripture, the ſame it witneſſeth in our ſouls, 1 Cor. 14.24, 25.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Water</hi> bears witneſſe in our hearts to this truth, that is, the water of Sanctification doth ſo cleanſe, and cool, and refreſh the conſcience of a man, and make him ſo fruitful in his Chriſtian courſe, that it's plainly a divine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, it paſſeth all the power of the creature thus to pacifie and quiet the conſcience; it is only the Spirit of God that is able thus to pacifie a guilty ſoul; thus to cleanſe an impure heart, and to make theſe dry barren ſtocks as we are fruitful; this is a divine work of Gods Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 <hi>The bloud</hi> of Chriſt witneſſeth this truth to our hearts, by being ſprinkled on our conſciences, and ſo ſpeaking peace to us; this is a divine work.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 This divine teſtimony is more certain, then all the teſtimonies of the world, becauſe God is greater in knowledge, and ſo knows more then men can.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Becauſe he is greater in truth; men may erre, but God cannot lye, Tit. 1.2, 3. Rom. 4.2.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 He lets us plainly ſee the danger of ſin, and the vertue and worth of Chriſts bloud; God reveals his Son to our hearts, John 3.12. Gal. 1.46. ſo what the Goſpel ſpeaks of his Son, the ſame is plainly revealed, and ſo he makes the object perſpicuous.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 He opens the eyes of men to diſcern it, to long after it, to taſt of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15. A natural man ſees nothing of this work.</p>

From the teſtimony of the Church, ſay they; ſo that their beſt faith is but humane credulity: But ask a true Proteſtant, why he believes <hi>Jeſus to be the Son of God?</hi> he tels you becauſe the Scripture ſay ſo; ask him why he believes the Scripture? he ſaith, not becauſe the Church believes ſo, but he believes it from a teſtimony within himſelfe. What ſay they, you truſt a private ſpirit of your own? nay his private ſpirit is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with him to all believers, ever ſince the world was, and that ſpirit is no other then the Spirit of God that breatheth in all his children.

                     <p>That Doctrine that lifts the Church from Chriſt, and builds it on the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Fathers and the Schools, that doctrine overthrows the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for other foundation can no man lay, then what is laid already, even Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It refutes another uncomfortable doctrine of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, that teach, that a man cannot by divine faith have aſſurance of his eſtate in grace and ſalvation; for ſay they, all divine faith is generall; thus he that repents and believes ſhall be ſaved, but I repent and believe, this ſay they, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no where ſaith: But ſay we, beſides the teſtimony of the Scripture, there is a <hi>threefold witneſſe in heaven,</hi> and <hi>three on earth,</hi> all witneſſing this truth; now their teſtimony is divine, and therefore my faith is divine, and they all witneſſe to this truth, <hi>that Jeſus is the Son of God;</hi> and that I believing on him ſhall be ſaved.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 That every teſtimony God gives us is true, Act. 27.25. <hi>I believe God, that it ſhall be ſo as he hath ſaid,</hi> but to believe on God, or on the Son of God, is a phraſe peculiar only to Scripture, not found in any humane Writers.</p>
                     <p>Now to believe that there is a God, and that his Word is true, are acts of the underſtanding; but to believe on God, is not only an act of my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but of my will; whereby I truſt on him, and rowl my ſelfe upon him, it's expreſt by laying a ſtone upon a foundation, 1 Pet. 2.5, 6. Chriſt lyes as the corner ſtone of his Church, every living ſtone lyes upon him, depends upon him, and that is to believe on God, to lift up our ſouls, and lye on the foundation, John 14.1. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe on God, believe alſo on me;</hi> ſo much belief ſo much leſſe fear; and ſo much fear, ſo much leſſe faith, Jam. 2.19. <hi>The Devils believe and tremble;</hi> but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves on the Son of God feare not, this believing on him, is a reſting on him, for many may have faith, and not reſt on Chriſt, Iſa. 30.15. <hi>In quietneſſe and confidence ſhall be your reſt,</hi> there is no ſuch rowling our ſelves upon Chriſt; ſo that as living ſtones we lye ſtill and quiet upon Chriſt the corner ſtone, ſo that you cannot lift off a Chriſtian from his foundation, except you overthrow the building, and this is, when a Chrſtian is ſo eſtabliſhed in faith, that all miſts of doubtings are removed, and Gods favour clearely ſeen, and then the ſoul ſits down in calmneſſe, and quiet, Pſal. 3.5, 6. and this hand of faith the children of God are wont to put forth in dangerous times, Pſal. 91.12. <hi>He that abideth in the ſecret place of the moſt High, &amp;c.</hi> Two things are in God, which are the ſecret place of the Almighty, and both expreſt in the Name of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Which implyes, 1 his attributes of mercy, goodneſſe, and patience, and the like.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 His truth, Pſal. 138.4. <hi>Thou haſt exalted thy word about thy Name,</hi> the Word of God doth more comfort, and command, then any attribute without the Word; ſo that the Name of God, is the ſecret place of God in danger; A Chriſtian runs to the attributes and promiſes of God.</p>

                        <pb n="374" facs="tcp:65998:190"/>2. But if this were all, it would exclude from faith, all thoſe whoſe faith is not grown to this quietneſſe and reſt, for many a day is it before we come to ſuch quietneſſe and reſt, but full of doubts and agitations are we: as if you commit ſuch a ſum of money to be paid at <hi>London,</hi> into a faithfull able mans hand; I never doubt of his care or faithfulneſſe, if I doubt of either, my heart is never at reſt, till I hear how matters goe? no Chriſtian ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily doubts of Gods power and ability; but he doubts whether God be willing to put forth his power for my ſalvation or no; hence a poor ſoule hath many thoughts and cares what will become of his ſoul, yet there is ſome kinde of ſaving faith in him that believes his ability, and this faith makes him in ſome meaſure to lean on Chriſt, as <hi>Mark</hi> 1.40. the poor Leper came to Jeſus, and ſaid, <hi>If thou wilt thou canſt make me clean,</hi> he believed his power, yet ſomething doubts of his will; yet he comes to him that he might be willing.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is a weaker faith then this, that is, a Chriſtian comes ſometimes to doubt even of the power of God, that he is not able to ſhew him mercy, and ſo doubts of it, as thus, becauſe God hath ſaid, <hi>That they that have ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt ſhall never be forgiven,</hi> and they are afraid they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this ſin, and they know God is not able to break his word, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.22. There comes a poor man to Chriſt for help for his ſon, and ſaid, <hi>If thou canſt doe any thing, have compaſſion on us;</hi> What ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If thou canſt believe, all things are poſſible to him that believeth? viz,</hi> that I am able; why, ſaith he, <hi>Lord I believe, help my unbeliefe,</hi> he believed God was able to help him, and yet was not certain of it neither, and yet this faith procured this bleſſing from God.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How can this be called believing on Chriſt, when the heart is not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Chriſt, nor reſts on him?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> As to believe on Chriſt, is to reſt on him, as a ſtone on the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo there is a believing on Chriſt, when the heart yet reſts not one Chriſt, but rowls it ſelfe on Chriſt, and that may be done, while the heart is yet in motion. Reſting is a ſetledneſſe of condition, but rowling is an unſetled tumbling about, ſometimes rowls one way, ſometimes another; yet ſuch a Chriſtian believes on Chriſt, becauſe he is rowling towards him; that ſo he may lie on him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. <hi>Commit thy ways to the Lord,</hi> in the original, <hi>rowl thy ways upon God,</hi> lean thy ſoul that way, that is done by rowling thy ſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, that thou mightſt reſt on him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Truſt on the Lord with all thy heart,</hi> lean not on thy own wiſdome: a man may be ſaid to lean that way, whereon he is not yet ſetled.</p>

When a man is perſwaded that God is able to help him, yet doubts of his willingneſſe, and yet comes to him, leans towards him, craves his help: as <hi>Mark</hi> 5.25. there comes a woman to Chriſt with a bloudy iſſue, ſhe came, neither doubting of his ability, nor will, <hi>If I may but touch the hemme of his garment, I ſhall be made whole,</hi> this was a reſting on Chriſt: But the poor Leper was not come ſo far, as to aſſure himſelfe that Chriſt would doe it; but he believes his power, and uſeth the means to make him willing, <hi>Lord if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean</hi>

that God is able to help him, if not, yet if he be grieved for his unbelief, and prayes to God to help his unbelief, this is coming to Chriſt, that is, making towards him, and this is faith. Suppoſe a man tell you in ſuch a field of yours is a rich treaſure, if you believe the man, will you not goe about to dig it up? but if you doubt of the truth, then you let it alone: ſo God tels you all the treaſures of life and grace are laid up in Chriſt this record God gives of his Son; now if we believe this record, we will uſe all good means to attain this eternal life, otherwiſe if we doe not uſe the means to get this treaſure, <hi>we make God a lyar;</hi> as if his record were not true.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Its laid up in Chriſt as one that prepares it for us, and us for it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. its he that <hi>makes us meet to be made partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> that whereas before we were unfit, now he hath adorned us, and made us fit Spouſes for himſelfe, which he doth by turning us from darkneſſe to light, by giving us of his Spirit, by diſpenſing himſelfe to us in his Sacraments, and Chriſtian communion, wherein all the members receive nouriſhment from the head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. and as he thus prepares us for <hi>eternall life,</hi> ſo likewiſe he prepares a place for us, <hi>John</hi> 14.2, 3.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe all the claim of eternall life is laid up onely in him, we neither deſire nor beg any pardon of ſin, or any grace, or comfort, or glory, but through Jeſus Chriſt, the claim of <hi>eternall life</hi> is wholly in him; for though God hath promiſed all thoſe kindes of life, its onely in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As he reſerves the claim of it in his own hands, ſo he reſerves the ſecurity of it in his own hand, even as a Father doubting how his ſon will ſpend his eſtate, he puts not into his hands the writings or evidences, but he keeps them in his own hands; ſo God ſaw the life he communicated to our firſt parents, they prodigally waſted it away, and therefore never ſince would he put it into our own hands, but reſerved it in the hands of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Therefore it is faith that the promiſe might be ſure.</hi> If our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation had ſtood upon our own works, the promiſe had been ſure onely ſo long as we kept our obedience, but we are unſetled, ſometimes inlarged, and ſometimes ſtraightned, ſo that we ſhould have been at a ſtand oftentimes, not knowing whether we had life or no, therefore he hath laid it up in Chriſt, that it might be ſure.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The poſſeſſion of this life is reſerved for us in Chriſt, our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is complete in Chriſt here, never increaſed, though the ſence of it may; the firſt day we are regenerate, we are fully juſtified; the juſtification of all Chriſtians is equall, though their ſanctification be not alike; our life of juſtification is compleat, but yet our life of holineſſe is but imperfect, <hi>We know but in part, and believe but in part,</hi> but its fully laid up in Chriſt: ſo for the life of conſolation, we have ſome beginnings of it here, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. But ſometimes all our comforts are loſt, and where then lies it but in Chriſt; as the ſap doth in the root in winter time, ſo that in him we rejoyce alwayes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. and ſo our eternall life is reſerved in him, <hi>John</hi> 14.2, 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, In regard of the glorious manifeſtation of this life at the laſt day, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. when he ſhall come to be admired of all his Saints, this life is now laid up for his Saints, which at that day he will diſpenſe to his ſervants, to the admiration of all men.</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p n="2">2. In our hearts and wills, we have Chriſt, when we look at him as our chiefeſt good, that there is nothing in heaven or earth, that we deſire in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of him, this is an act of the will and affections, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. this is called hungering and thirſting after Chriſt; No hunger is ſatisfied, without eating of that we hunger after; ſo when a ſoul hungers and thirſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, give him pleaſures and profits, yet they ſatisfie not, except you give him Chriſt; and this is an high point of worſhip, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. when our hearts are ſet on him, that our chiefeſt care is to get him, our greateſt griefe to loſe him, our chiefeſt delight in him; why, if we be thus affected to Chriſt, we have him.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. We worſhip Chriſt in our lives, by our obedience in doing his will, and by patience in ſuffering for him. Our obedience is a true worſhip of Chriſt, 1. When a man hath ſuch reſpect to all Gods Commandements in his heart, that there is not one of them, but he hath reſpect unto, and ſubmits his heart to it, this is a principall part of Gods worſhip, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6, 2. When he hath reſpect to them all in his converſation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. The Goſpel of Chriſt brings every thought into ſubjection; now this is a marvellous worſhip of Chriſt, when a man hath not a thought in him, but it is ſubjected to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We worſhip Chriſt in our lives, by our patience in ſuffering, if the Lord call us to ſuffer for him, when we can ſit down quietly, and reſt well contented to endure his good pleaſure with patience, this is a principall part of Gods worſhip, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.18. It was a good teſtimony of <hi>Elies</hi> ſincerity, when he heard of a wofull judgement denounced againſt him, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe what ſeemeth good in his eyes,</hi> we have the Lord for our Lord, when we give him leave to rule us as he pleaſeth, and patiently ſubmit our ſelves unto him in every thing, <hi>Job</hi> 1.21. an argument we have God for our God, otherwiſe how ſhould we complain and murmur at the inſtruments? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.29. The Church complaining of her miſery, tells us the frame of her Spirit, in ſuch a time it is good to bear the yoak in our youth, ſhe ſits alone and keeps ſilence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.1, 2. <hi>Micah</hi> 7.7, 8. This is a ſolemn worſhip of Chriſt; if God call a man to ſuffer for his Name divers evills, he is ſo far from being aſhamed of it, that it is his glory and rejoycing; if any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him rejoyce in that behalfe, when a man is thus framed to obedience in doing, and patience in ſuffering the will of God, ſuch a ſoul is a true worſhipper of Chriſt, and by worſhipping him, we have him; if contrary, we look at Chriſt as no ſuch excellent thing but are aſhamed of him; if we can look at our ſelves as great men in the world, and ſcorn to ſeek and mourn after Chriſt, when we will not be under Chriſts yoak, but ſcorn to ſtoop to him in every thing, and by no means we will endure any hardſhip for him; why, then we doe not worſhip Chriſt, and if we doe not worſhip him, we have him not, and not having him we have no life.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We are ſaid to have Chriſt by purchaſe, this is expreſt partly in that parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.46. One way to have this Pearl, is to buy it, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2. <hi>Come and buy, yea without money;</hi> why, <hi>without money? Cant.</hi> 8.7. If a man ſhould give all the treaſure of his houſe for Chriſt, they would be greatly diſpiſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.19. when <hi>Simon Magus</hi> offered money, for the gift of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Peter</hi> tells him, <hi>Thy money periſh with thee,</hi> yet many times without parting with money we cannot have him, the holding faſt of money oft-times looſeth Chriſt; upon this ground the young man went without him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 21, to 25. Upon the poynt of money Chriſt parted with the <hi>Phariſees, Luke</hi> 16.14.</p>
                     <p>In three caſes money muſt be parted with, elſe you ſhall not purchaſe Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, When the Lord upon ſome ſpeciall command requires it, as he did the young man expreſſely; now for him to ſtick for money, for want of parting with it, he loſt Chriſt; upon the ſame point <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> loſt Chriſt,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:65998:195"/>
becauſe <hi>they kept back ſome of the price,</hi> Acts 5.1, 2, 3, 4. a fearfull judgement felt on them, to ſhew how dangerous it is to ſtand upon tearms with Chriſt; in this caſe money muſt be parted withall.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, When in times of perſecution, a man cannot have Chriſt with peace and purity, unleſſe he be willing to part with all for him, as ſometimes the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, When ſometimes by laying out money, we may win Chriſt, as in caſe we want a good Miniſtry among us, and cannot have it unleſſe we be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As in a Scholar, when a man hath been given to looſe vain courſes, yet when God begins to enlighten his mind, and to enlarge his affection, and comfort his ſoul; 'tis a wonder to think what a change it will work in a Scholar; ſo that now he will leave his old vain courſes, and compoſe himſelfe to more edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſpiritualneſſe in his teachings: why; ſuch a change works ſuch a confidence in him, that he thinks all the Congregation may ſooner periſh then he; and if Miniſters may be deceived upon thoſe common gifts and graces, how much more may people be deceived? <hi>Herods</hi> joy, and <hi>Jehues</hi> zeal, all theſe you may have and yet want Chriſt, a man may have theſe, and yet not prize Chriſt, not give up himſelfe to him, he may ſtill reſerve ſome luſt which he favours; therefore if thou haſt ſuch common graces, obſerve, in the midſt of thoſe, whether thou cleaveſt not to ſome luſts, for ſo Chriſt ſhall tell ſuch at the laſt day, <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquities:</hi> if thou beeſt a worker of iniquity, all thy good gifts and parts will deceive thee in the end, but if in the midſt of ſuch gifts and graces, thou haſt a care to keep thy heart clean, and doeſt favour no luſt, and doſt not place any confidence in theſe, but in Chriſt, thy caſe is ſafe; for this is a true rule: hypocrites though they have many good common gifts and graces, yet they are given up to ſome ſinfull way, by which the world ſhall know

A mans heart may be too low through deſpair, many a poor <hi>ſoul,</hi> after his high thoughts are puld down, he ſinks down ſo low into deſpair, that he thinks no promiſe or mercy belongs to him; Why, this heart is too low for Chriſt, therefore it behoves a chriſtian to beleeve there is an hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning this; Chriſt hath had mercy on as bad as me, and therefore we will lay our mouths in the duſt, till he ſhall have mercy on us; and if he offer grace, we are willing to receive it,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Crooked things muſt be made ſtraight; there are in our hearts many turnings in and out, theſe muſt be made ſtraight, it's when we look with a ſingle eye, and are willing to be guided by a ſtraight rule, and aim ſingly at Gods ends, ſuch an heart is fit for Chriſt, when it's cleanſed from all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. 2. There is another crookedneſſe of our hearts, when we ſhift off and cover ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.5. but to prevent it, Chriſt will, have us deale plainly, diſcover our ſins openly before God, and then is Chriſt ready to come ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly into his Temple.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Rough places muſt be made ſmooth, many a mans heart is rough and harſh, and bitter; why, God will have this frame of heart laid down, all bitterneſſe and wrath put away, and the heart made loving and meek; the Lamb Chriſt will not reſt in Lyons dens, therefore rhe Apoſtle bids us <hi>lay aſide all wrath and malice;</hi> when our rough hearts are made ſmooth end amiable; why, then undoubtedly Chriſt will come into his Temple. 2. When Chriſt is come into our hearts, if we would look to keep him there, we muſt look to it, that there be no common and unclean thing found there, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18. This Temple is an holy place, therefore put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way not only unclean, but common things; all your affairs muſt be dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Lord, all your wealth and ſtore, all your houſhold and children muſt be conſecrate to the Lord, Chriſt loves to lye clean, he diſlikes even bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſlovenlineſſe, much more ſpirituall defilements. 3. To receive Chriſt into his Temple, is to look well to the charge of Gods holy offerings; God would have every man in particular to take the charge of his holy things on himſelfe, and not put it off to others; let every one keep his charge, every one offer up his dayly ſacrifice, and his ſervice for the Sabbath; all Gods offerings muſt be looked to, and if we doe thus, God will reſt in his holy Temple for ever, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.2. conſider therefore whether you have thus received Chriſt, have you found your proud hearts humbled, your baſe earthly hearts lifted up to Gods wayes, all crooked by-paths of hypocriſie and ſhifting put away; doe you find your rough ſpirits made ſmooth and amiable? Why, if it be ſo, then Chriſt is come, and when he is come, doe you ſtrive to keep your hearts clean, and undefiled, and dedicate your ſelves and yours to God, you keep the charge of Gods holy offerings, and ſet up his Ordinances amongſt you; why, then we have received Chriſt: <hi>è contra,</hi> if we find it not thus, we have no Chriſt, and ſo no life. Hitherto we have heard what it is to have Chriſt; the ſecond thing to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after, is, What it is to have the Son, <hi>He that hath the Son hath life,</hi> it is not enough to have Chriſt, but if we would have life, we muſt have Chriſt as the Son.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What then is it to have the Son?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are three things implyed in having the Son. 1. That ſuch a have Chriſt in truth, doe not reſt ſo much in having any of the benefits of Chriſt, but they doe chiefly affect to have the Son himſelfe: many profeſſors ſought after Chriſt for the loaves ſake, <hi>John</hi> 16.26, 27. But Chriſt bids them
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:65998:197"/>
not to labour for the meat that periſheth, but to labour for Chriſt himſelf, the bread of life: hereby <hi>Peter</hi> diſcovered hypocriſie of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> in that he deſired the gift of Chriſt, but not Chriſt himſelf, and ſuch gifts as might tend to profit; but <hi>Peter</hi> tell him, <hi>Thy money periſh with thee,</hi> Act. 8.18, 19. So <hi>Balaam</hi> wiſhed, <hi>O that I might dye the death of the righteous,</hi> Numb. 23.10. but he deſired not Chriſt, but own happineſse and freedom from hell and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and therefore what ever gift he had beſides, as indeed he had a goodly gift of propheſie, he never ſought Chriſt in any of them. Nay further, a true chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that affects Chriſt himſelf ſeeks him, not only without reſpect to profit or gain, or happineſſe hereafter, but even here in this life, in the Ordinances of God, wherein he ſeeks for help againſt his luſts, for increaſe of grace, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of comfort, he doth not ſo affect them, as to find Chriſt in them: When <hi>David</hi> fled from <hi>Abſalon,</hi> and the Prieſts carryed the Ark after him, as knowing, they ſhould never meet with a Prince that more favoured and upheld Gods worſhip, then he; <hi>David</hi> bad the Prieſts carry back the Ark again, <hi>If I ſhall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me back again, and ſhew me both it and his habitation;</hi> but if he ſay, <hi>I have no delight in thee, here I am, let him doe what ſeemeth him good,</hi> as if he had ſaid, the Church ſhall not be ſo much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced as to be deprived of the Ark of God for my ſake, without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not offer their ſolemn Sacrifices, nor find the preſence of God, therefore he conſiders, that thereby Gods Name ſhould be diſhonoured, and the Church wronged, and rather then he would doe that, he would part with the very Ark, the preſence of God, and his Ordinances, which yet was his greateſt care and deſire, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. Now this is an argument of grace in ſincerity, to be willing to part with the Ordinances, rather then have God diſhonoured, and the Church prejudiced. This was <hi>Moſes</hi> care, rather then God ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by the Heathen, he would have God blot his name out of the book of life, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.32, 33. A true chriſtian perfers Gods honour, above the pardon of ſin, above the beſt graces, yea above ſalvation it ſelf; if a chriſtian deſire the Ordinances, it is that he may find the beauty and loving kindneſſe of the Lord in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3. if he deſire the ſubduing of his luſts, it's not ſo much for his own comfort, as that the power of Chriſt might he magnified in him; he deſired, ſalvation, if he deſires gifts and graces, it is not that he might be made excellent, but that the grace of Chriſt might be magnified in him; if he deſire ſalvation, it not ſo much for his own joy and happineſſe, as that he may be with Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.28. having a deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt, which is far better, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt of ten thouſand,</hi> not only of perſons, but <hi>the chiefeſt of ten thouſand</hi> benefits and priviledges which God gives, pardon of ſin, and grace, and comfort, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it ſelf, Chriſt is better then all theſe, and he that thus affects Chriſt, <hi>hath the Son,</hi> and ſo <hi>hath life.</hi> Grounds of this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Chriſt muſt be ſo received as God gives him, but God gives us Chriſt firſt, in every Ordinance: when <hi>Philip</hi> preached to the Eunuch, it's ſaid <hi>he preached Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to him,</hi> Act. 8.35. So in the Sacrament, you muſt firſt take and eat his fleſh, and drink his blood, and then you have remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. No gift of grace but is given through Chriſt, if it be lively and true. <hi>Herod</hi> received joy, <hi>Jehu</hi> zeal, <hi>Ahab</hi> humiliation, but none of theſe received life, becauſe they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſhell and not the kernel, the casket, and not the Pearl, the gift, but not Chriſt; and therefore their graces were not lively. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> believed yet had no lively faith, becauſe Chriſt wanting: except we find Chriſt, we find no true grace, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.8. in me is thy fruit found, <hi>without me you can doe nothing,</hi> Joh. 15.5. Hence let us gather an eſtimate of our ſelves, whether we have life or not, <hi>If you have the Son, you have life,</hi> try therefore whether you labour not more for the loaves, for the benefits of Chriſt, then for Chriſt himſelf; if thou findeſt thou comeſt to the Ordinances rather to find Chriſt, then the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, and comfort, and happineſſe, and ſalvation; if with the Church in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> thou ſeekeſt Chriſt and not the loaves, if thou with her inquireſt

of the watchmen, where thou mayſt <hi>find him whom thy ſoul loveth,</hi> if we thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Chriſt, we have the Son, we could never have ſought him thus, if he had not firſt ſought us: but <hi>è contra,</hi> if we have longing deſires after pardon of ſin, and after grace and ſalvation, thoſe deſires indeed are ordinarily ſincere, but there may be an Harlots affection in them; as an Harlot ſeeks her an husband not for his perſons ſake, but for his goods ſake, that her debts may be paid, and that ſhe may be a ſharer in his wealth, now ſhe ſeeks him not for his ends, but for her own: ſo if a man ſhall deſire Chriſt, that he may have his ſins pardoned, and his conſcience pacified, and ſeek not Chriſt himſelf; why, this is but an whoriſh affection; whereas one that loves her husband, ſhe will have him though ſhe have but the bare man, though ſhe begge with him; ſo one that truly loves Chriſt, he would be glad and think himſelfe happy to have him, though he ſhould never ſee good day after, never find peace or quiet after, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is nothing on earth, that I deſire in compariſon of thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This will exclude from having of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. All ſuch as are ſo far from ſeeking Chriſt himſelfe, that they doe not ſeek the benefits of Chriſt, they look at grace and chriſtian duties as melancholly weariſome things, for pardon of ſins, they never look after it, and for heaven they hope they ſhall doe as well as others; why, theſe men they will neither have Chriſt nor any thing of his.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This excludes ſuch from having Chriſt, as have more deſire of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits then Chriſt himſelf, pardon of ſin, and grace, and peace of conſcience, and comfort that they look after, but Chriſt they forget; why, as yet our ſeeking is not ſincere: if a woman perceive that her love ſeeks more for wealth and dowry, then her perſon, no wonder, if ſhe hold off; ſo if Chriſt find we come to him, and ſeek for pardon of ſin, and grace, and peace, more then for himſelf, no wonder if he keep off and hide himſelfe from us, becauſe this may come from ſelf-love, from reſpect to our own good, and yet nature teacheth us not to ſeek ſuch things, and thoſe deſires are ordinarily good beginnings; for indeed chriſtians at firſt are full of ſelf-love, but yet Chriſt will never fully reveale himſelfe, till we ſeek his perſon rather then his gifts, therefore firſt labour to get Chriſt and he will bring all theſe priviledges with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.32. ſeek him chiefly and not his gifts; you muſt firſt know Chriſt will be more loved for his own ſake then his gifts, before he ſay to you as to the church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>O my Dove, let me ſee thy Countenance, let me hear thy voyce for ſweet is thy voyce, and thy countenance lovely,</hi> before he thus manifeſt himſelf to thee, he will make thee willing to ſeek thee as thy head and husband, as the moſt wiſe, the moſt beautifull, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand; and let but thy deſire be towards him, and his deſire will be towards thee, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.3. Stand not upon dowries, take him without Feoffments, for better, for worſe: and if you thus take Chriſt, and chooſe his perſon in the firſt place, then all his benefits and priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come yours, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. 2. A child of God is ſaid to have the Son, when he hath the Spirit of the Son, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. Having ſpoken before of a Spirit of miniſtration and grace; why, ſaith he, <hi>the Lord is that Spirit,</hi> not only becauſe he is the giver of it, but there is a ſecret union betwixt Chriſt and his Spirit, ſo that if you have the one, you have the other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. If any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. he that hath the Son, hath the Spirit of the Son, and is made conformable to his Image.</p>
                     <p>There is a twofold Spirit whereby we are knit to Chriſt, and Chriſt to us 1. A Spirit of union. 2. A Spirit of liberty.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He that hath fellowſhip with Chriſt, hath a Spirit of union, whereby he is made one with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. It's the prayer of our Saviour for all belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that they al may be one, <hi>As thou father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us,</hi> thou in me by thy Spirit, and I in them by the ſame Spirit, hence it is, <hi>that of his fulneſſe we ſhall receive grace for grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>We are predeſtinate to be made like to the Image of Chriſt.</hi> There is a threefold conformity

and likeneſſe betwixt Chriſt and us, that is wrought by the Spirit.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. There is a conformity in his offices, he hath made us Prieſts, Kings and Prophets to his Father, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6.

                     <p n="3">3. There is a conformity in their eſtate: our Saviour in this world went through a double eſtate, 1. Of Humiliation, 2.

                     <p n="4">4 The Spirit of God that ſets me free from the ſervice of men, makes me free to every duty of God, to have free acceſs to him, the Spirit that ſet me at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from Satan, will make me run the wayes of Gods Commandements with an inlarged heart, Pſal. 119.32. Pſ. 110.3. Gods people are a willing people and as he is free from the bondage of men, ſo he is Lord over them, he can make them all ſerve him; Gen. 25.23. God told <hi>Rebecca</hi> there were Nations in her womb, and the elder ſhould ſerve the yonger, how was that fulfilled, ſeeing <hi>Jacob</hi> cals <hi>Eſau</hi> Lord, and himſelf his ſervant?

                     <p>We are ready commonly to conceive, that every one would have Chriſt for his Saviour, but indeed they are but rare that would have a Saviour indeed. To have Chriſt for our Saviour implyes two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 He that hath Chriſt for his Saviour, looks up to him for ſalvation in all his diſtreſſes, Iſa. 45.22. <hi>Look unto me, and be ſaved, all ye ends of the earth.</hi> He that looks for any other Saviour, denyes Chriſt. He that hath Chriſt for his Saviour, in what coaſts ſoever of the world he lives, he muſt look up to him for ſalvation, as they that look'd towards the Temple, had their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions heard: So, whereſoever we are in what condition ſoever, we muſt look towards Chriſt, and long after him for ſalvation, not onely from Gods wrath, and hell, but even from whatever diſtreſſes we are in, torment of conſcience, ſickneſſe, impriſonment; we muſt wait upon him for deliverance. Iſa. 8.17. <hi>I will wait upon the Lord that hideth his face from the houſe of Jacob, and I will look for him.</hi> The Church was then in grievous diſtreſſe, both in regard of ſin and calamity, there were none for her to look unto, either Princes or Prieſts, to redreſſe the matter, all had been in vain; but there was no hope in them, yet <hi>I will look unto the Lord, and wait on him that hideth his face,</hi> Iſa. 17.7. Speaking of ſuch times wherein only a few gleaning grapes ſhould be left. <hi>In that day ſhall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes ſhall have reſpect to the holy one of Iſrael.</hi> We caſt reſpect or diſreſpect upon one with our eye, whileſt our eyes are upon the creature, and turned away from God, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect God; but when our eyes are toward him, ſet on him, we ſhew reſpect to God, and this man hath Chriſt for his onely Saviour. This was <hi>Jehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phats</hi> practice, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. Being in a great fear of a mighty hoſte that came againſt him, he ſet himſelfe to ſeek God, and prayed, <hi>O Lord, we know not what to do, but our eyes are towards thee.</hi> This having our eyes towards Chriſt in evill times, argues that we have Chriſt for our Saviour, Pſal. 121.1. <hi>I will lift up my eyes to the hills, from whence cometh my help.</hi> And he means the Hils of <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Moriah,</hi> where the Temple and Ordinances were. <hi>My help cometh from the Lord who made heaven and earth. Jonah</hi> went away from God when he ſhould have gon to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> he ſent him to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> but he fled to <hi>Tarſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh;</hi> and therefore, becauſe he would not have God for his Prince to rule him, he would not be his Saviour, but ſent out a mighty tempeſt againſt him, and the moſt unruly creature of the Sea to ſwallow him up; and then <hi>Jonah</hi> out of hopes prayes out of the Whales belly, <hi>If I am utterly caſt out of his ſight, yet I will look again towards his holy Temple,</hi> Jonah 2.4. His heart had reſpect to it, though he could not tell which way it ſtood, and in that he had reſpect to Chriſt, a d therefore the Lord ſent him a glorious deliverance, If you have Chriſt for your Saviour, your eyes will be towards him in every diſtreſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 He that hath Chriſt for his Saviour, not onely looks for ſalvation by him from all his diſtreſſes, but from all his ſins likewiſe, Pſal. 130.7, 8. <hi>He ſhall redeem Iſrael from all his ſins,</hi> and therefore his name is called <hi>Jeſus,</hi> Mat. 1.21.

God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the evill lives of his people, that they were <hi>like wild aſſes, ſnuffing up the wind at their pleaſure;</hi> and when he call'd to them, <hi>Withhold thy foot from being unſhod;</hi> they ſaid deſperately, <hi>No, ſtrangers have I followed, and after them will I goe.</hi> How doe ſuch men look for Chriſt to be their Saviour, when they will not be delivered from their ſins? when Chriſt comes to caſt out their ſins, they are ready to cry as the man poſſeſt with the Devills, <hi>Art thou come to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us before our time?</hi> Pulling away their ſins from them, is a grievous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their ſouls: do but take away their hopes of ſome gainful ſin, and they are inraged, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.19.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If we have Chriſt for our Saviour, we muſt have him for our Prince, Act. 5.31. that is, we muſt reſigne up our ſelves and ſubmit our ſelves to him. Iſa. 9.6. <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Son is born, to us a child is given.</hi> And why, how ſhall I know whether the Son be given me? Why, <hi>the government is upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two wayes we are ſaid to have Chriſt for our Governour,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 When we reſigne up our ſelves in obedience to him, when we have not a thought within us but is brought into ſubjection to the Lord Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.5. The thoughts of the righteous are right thoughts, coming from a right ground, guided by a right rule, tending to a right end.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>But, whoſe heart is ſo right, that every thought is ſubdued to the will of Chriſt? Who is there but have many vain thoughts lodge in them?</hi> Jerem. 4.14.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> He that hath Chriſt for his Prince, will not have a vain thought lodge in him; indeed, evill thoughts may ruſh in upon him, as ſturdy beggers into an houſe, and they would be Maſters, and have every one tend upon them; but a Chriſtian, he ſuffers them not to lodge there, he reſts not till they be thrown out of dores, they finde no welcome in his heart: Indeed, a Chriſtian man may have many evill thoughts within him, but yet here is the difference between him and the carnall man, a wicked man that hath not Chriſt, he hath not one good thought in him, the frame and inclination of, his heart is wholly evill, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. Or if good thoughts or motions be caſt in to ſtir him up to repentance; why, they ſuffer them not to lodge there, but they bid them come another time; whereas a good man, if a good thought come, it's moſt welcome to him, he entertains it; and cheriſheth it, even as a Meſſenger ſent from his Prince.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If an evill thought come into a natural mans heart, it's connatural to him, it finds lodging and welcome there, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18, 19. But a godly man, if an evill thought come, he looks at it as an enemy and traitor, he calls to all the family, to all the faculties of the ſoul to help againſt it: and if he be not ſtrong enough, he calls to all his Chriſtian friends, but eſpecially he calls to his Prince to deliver him, even as a good Subject that hath a Traitor got into his houſe, that plots treaſon againſt the King, and ſpoyls his goods, and he is not able to get rid of him, be ſecretly ſends to his Prince for ayd. This courſe <hi>David</hi> took, Pſal. 139.23. <hi>Search me, O Lord, and try me.</hi> He would have God to make privy ſearch, and find out the frame of his heart; unlike to them, Iſa. 29.15. And then <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>See if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:65998:200"/>
way everlaſting.</hi> And if he would have God to be ruler over his thoughts, then much more of his words and actions. Now there are ſome men whoſe hearts are like the high-way ground, let evill thoughts come and goe at their pleaſures, they will not be ſubject to Chriſt. <hi>As for this man, we will not have him rule over us,</hi> Luke 19.14. What ſay they? <hi>Thoughts are free,</hi> and <hi>our tongues are our own, who ſhall controll us?</hi> Whereas a Chriſtian would have God rule all his thoughts and words; nay, a carnall heart is ſo wonderfully deſperate, that they will not onely not be ſervants to God, but they will make God ſervant to them. Iſa. 43.24. <hi>Thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, and wearyed me with thy iniquities.</hi> They make God to ſerve a weariſome ſervice, that as a cart is preſſed under the ſheaves, ſo is God under them; they load Gods patience with one ſin after another, pitch one ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, till he be burthened with our ſins; and what parts and gifts, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties God gives them, they abuſe to Gods diſhonour, And is not this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous rebellion, for poor creatures to make God ſerve a weariſome ſervice? Wonder not therefore if he ſay, <hi>Rebellion is as the ſin of witchcraft,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.26. As a Witch gives her ſoul to the devil, to have her own liberty for a while, ſo rebellious ſinners are at league with the devil and hel, to ſerve their luſts whilſt they live.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 As a witch makes the devil ſerve her all her life, but at death ſhe ſerves the devill; So God ſhall ſerve them all their life time, but at death they would ſerve God, and then they will do him the beſt ſervice they can. Why do you think God will accept our ſervice when we dye, when we have made him ſerve us all our life time?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To have Chriſt for our Prince is not onely to ſerve him, but we muſt give him Princely ſervice, ſuch ſervice as becomes ſo royall a Prince, Mal. 1.8. Serve not him with blinde and lame ſacrifices, but with the beſt and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt; crucifie your fatteſt and deareſt luſts to him, let him have your beſt parts, and beſt affections; righteous <hi>Abel</hi> brought to God the firſtlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. So let God have our firſt years, and the ſtrength of your affections, give not him your old, decrepit age. 2 Sam. 24.24. <hi>I will not offer to God</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) that which coſt me nothing. Araunah</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed gave them all freely to the King, like a King. If a man give to a King, he muſt give as to a King, he muſt give as a King. <hi>Nay,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) if you as a King give thoſe things to me, muſt not I then who am a King give as a King to that King of Kings?</hi> Let God have all you have, give up your ſelves and all your families to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For application.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Would you know then whether you have life? Why, if you have Chriſt, you have life; and if you would know whether you have Chriſt or no, you muſt conſider, God hath exalted him to be both Saviour and Prince. Doſt thou finde thy heart looking up to him for help in all thy miſeries? Then thou haſt him as a Saviour. If in caſes when thou knoweſt not what to doe, yet thy eyes are towards him? Why, this very looking towards him, is of an healing nature, as was the looking towards the brazen Serpent, <hi>Numb</hi> 21.9. The Conies are but a feeble folk, and yet they make their neſts in a rock; ſo, it's good for us in our diſtreſſes, to have recourſe to the rock that is higher then we.</p>
                     <p>Again conſider, are there any luſts in us that we deſire to be ſpared in, and would not be ſaved from? Why, then we have not Chriſt for our Saviour. So conſider, Have we Chriſt for our Prince? Do we ſubject every thought unto him? Doſt thou not entertain an evill thought? if they ruſh in upon thee, doſt thou ſtrive to thruſt them out? Then thou haſt Chriſt for thy Prince. But if thou findeſt evil thoughts in thy heart, and ſuffereſt them to reſt in thee. Doſt thou make God to ſerve a weariſome ſervice from moneth to moneth, and year to year, and over burthen his patience and mercy? Then Chriſti
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:65998:201"/>
not thine. If thou lookeſt at him as thy Prince, he ſhould have the beſt ſervice thou couldſt afford him.</p>
                     <p>A third head of ſignes whereby we may know whether we have Chriſt or no, is expreſt in the text, <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life.</hi> For we may as well argue from having of life that we have the Son, as from the having of the Son that we have uſe; they are reciprocall, <hi>he that hath the Son hath life,</hi> and <hi>he that hath life hath the Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Life</hi> is fourfold:

                     </p>
                     <p>If we have good evidences of the three former, we may have aſſurance of the latter.</p>
                     <p>The ſignes of life are of three ſorts, our ſpirituall life may be diſcerned three wayes:
<list>
                           <item>By the <hi>cauſes.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>For the <hi>cauſes,</hi> the holy Ghoſt gives us three cauſes of our ſpirituall life, which if we finde, we may aſſure our ſelves that we have life, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we have the Son.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Cauſe of our ſpirituall life, is Gods own good pleaſure. <hi>Of his owne will hath he begot us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Jam. 1.18. This St. <hi>John</hi> proves by denying all other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our begetting to life, John 13 <hi>Not of bloud:</hi> that is, not of parentage, for godly parents may have wicked children; though Gods commandement do much, yet it is not from their good parentag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſigne of the life of grace. Such a mans heart acknowledgeth all the grace he hath to be of Gods good pleaſure. Take a naturall man, he thinks well of him elf, that he hath alwayes had a good nature, and towardly, and hopefull, and all his friends could ſay no leſſe But now a regenerate Chriſtian acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>th that he had no heart to goodneſſe by nature, onely ſome outward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency towards his friends, to pleaſe them; but he acknowledgeth what <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>When it pleaſed God to call me by his grace, and to reveale Chriſt in me, then I lived,</hi> but not before. A living ſoul never attributes any thing to his good nature or towardlineſſe, but when it pleaſeth God to call him to his grace.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond cauſe of life is a word of promiſe; for, <hi>all that are of Abraham are not the Children of Abraham,</hi> onely the ſeed of promiſe, ſuch as are begot of a word of promiſe, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, and leaſt you ſhould think it belongeth to <hi>Iſaac</hi> onely, he makes it common to all the elect, that they are all children of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28. But yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> had the peculiar, in that even his birth was by promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah:</hi> But the Apoſtle would thereby inferre, that all our ſpirituall birth, is by a word of promiſe. Here therefore try thy life, thou ſayſt thou liveſt, but what word of promiſe wert thou begot of? <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> Rom: 10 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.5. There is ſome word of promiſe diſpearſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d in the word preached, which the ſoul layes hold of, and is thereby knit to Chriſt by faith: Indeed, many a good ſoul cannot tell what word of promiſe he was firſt begot of, yet ſure it was by a word of promiſe; and though thou doſt not know this promiſe, yet there is no <hi>Chriſtian</hi> but he ſuſtains himſelf by ſome promiſe, which ſhews plainly that he was bred of a promiſe which is fed by a promiſe. Many times a word of grace and wiſe admonition ſinks ſo deep into the heart, as that it makes many a one amend his wicked wayes,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:65998:201"/>
and take better courſes, and reform his life; but this is no evident ſigne of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life. So an hypocrite may be ſo far convinced as to turn the ſtream of his life, and yet without all power of godlineſſe, and the ground is, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive life from the words or works of the Law, it's altogether impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. All true ſpirituall life is from ſome word of promiſe that hath been diſpen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed to us in the Word. The word of the Law may reclaim us from giving outward offence, but yet without all reſpect or obedience to God. But when we are quickened by a word of promiſe, then the love of God conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth us.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>Is it not ordinary for the word of the Law to caſt down and humble us, before we can lay hold on a promiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> True. Yet this is not that which makes a man a new man, this may reach to the reformation of many outward ſins, but yet it gives not ſpirituall life, till we begin to think of, and long after Chriſt, and meditate and talk of him, till at length the ſight of Chriſt, doth ſo work on us, that we do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly long after him, but we ſo receive him, and imbrace him, that we are inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him.</p>
                     <p>A third cauſe of life, is the Spirit of God, <hi>John</hi> 3.6. There is a ſhedding abroad of the Spirit into the heart of every regenerate man, that he hath not the ſame ſpirit he had before. Now a mans ſpirit is the bent and inclination of the ſoul. Eph. 4.23. <hi>Be ye renewed in the ſpirits of your minds.</hi> The ſoul and the body is the ſame: But there is another ſpirit, they ſee other things they never ſaw before, judge otherwiſe then they did before; now they have new thoughts, and judgements, and affections, ſo that their heart is far off from earthly things, and let on ſpirituall things. <hi>All things are become new.</hi> A new heart, new conference, new imployment, new company, the whole man hath another frame of ſpirit in him. He that finds it thus hath life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For application.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conſider therefore how you finde your hearts ſpeaking concerning your eſtates. Do you finde indeed that ſometimes you have had good motions caſt in, but before God was pleaſed to call you to his grace, nothing did you good. Doe you finde your life wrought by a ſpirit of promiſe. Do you finde that you are renewed to a new inclination and frame of ſpirit, then you have life. Your life ſprings from true cauſes, if not you have not life.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond ſort of ſignes of life is from the effects of ſpirituall life; And,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Juſtification or pardon of ſins is a principall part of our ſpirituall life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2, 3. And this is called <hi>juſtification to life,</hi> Rom. 5.18. Even as a condemned mans pardon is the life of the man, ſo is the pardon of our ſins the life of our ſouls. Now the firſt effect flowing from the pardon of our ſin, is,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Some inward peace of conſcience, ſome inward ſatisfaction that he never found before. <hi>My ſin is not pardoned,</hi> at leaſt not manifeſted ſo to be, till I finde ſome meaſure of inward peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. What was it that burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thy conſcience, but guilt of ſin? If therefore God ſay to my ſoul, Son, thy ſins be forgiven thee; upon this follows the tranquility of the mind, and ſometimes in that unſpeakable manner, that paſſeth all underſtanding, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. Though this be not ſo ordinary, yet they alwayes finde a ſecret peace and eaſe, as if you had caſt off milſtones from the heart, Iſa. 32.17. The effect of righteouſneſſe is quietneſſe and aſſurance for ever; if ſin be pardoned, peace and everlaſting aſſurance follows.</p>
                     <p>A 2. effect of this life of Juſtification, is, that look as you ſee in a morall life, no man hath received life, but he ſtrives to maintain it, ſo that <hi>all that he hath will he give for his life;</hi> So, if thou haſt received the life of the pardon of thy ſins, thou ſhalt finde a ſerious, and conſtant care of preſerving
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:65998:202"/>
that life and peace, ſo that you will let all go rather then the peace of your conſcience. <hi>Thy loving kindneſſe is better then life,</hi> Pſal. 63.4. And therefore if I finde a tender care in me to maintain my peace, it's a ſigne I have received life, ſeeing I am ſo carefull to maintain it. A man that hath been in a great debt, and lately paid it, he is carefull to run on the ſcore no more; ſo when God hath blotted out the ſcore of our ſins, a Chriſtian is very ſollioitous to ſin no more, but that he may live an holy and ſpotleſſe life all his dayes. Notable is the example of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39. <hi>How ſhall I commit this great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe and ſin againſt God?</hi> How ſhall I break my peace of conſcience, and run on a new ſcore? Sometimes indeed Gods children have received pardon of ſins, and yet afterwards turned Gods grace into wantonneſſe; but withall obſerve if they have been overtaken with ſome grievous luſts, the loſſe of their peace, and favour of God, hath been more bitter to them then death it ſelf; and if the Lord give us hearts follicitous to maintain our peace, it is a ſign that he hath given us peace, thoſe ſins are pardoned which we abhor; it's the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of life to preſerve it ſelf, and to expell what may be an enemy to life: And this is a ſigne our peace is not counterfeit, but ſound, if we be carefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</p>
                     <p>A 3. effect of our life of Juſtification is that which our Saviour gives, Luke 7.47. <hi>Her ſins which are many are forgiven her, becauſe ſhe loves much.</hi> He that loves much hath much forgiven him. The love of God in ſome meaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the ſin pardoned, is a good evidence of the pardon of our ſins. Gods pardons are lively pardons, they leave not a man as he was, but whom he pardons them he heals. This woman was a notorious Harlot, her loving much ſhewed that her many ſins were forgiven her; according to the multitude and meaſure of ſins pardoned, ſuch is the meaſure of our love to God and his Saints; And indeed, there is none hath ſo little forgiven him, but he thinks it a great deal, as indeed well he may, and thinks himſelfe bound to love God abundantly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For application.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conſider therefore what peace thou haſt. Perhaps thou wilt ſay, I have had peace all my life long, but ſuch peace is ill rooted, it ſprings not from a word of God; And,</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It's fruitleſſe. Thou ſayſt thou haſt peace, but what care haſt thou to maintain it, and to expell thy ſins which hinder thy peace? And again, if thou haſt ſuch peace, where is thy love? If that be wanting, pardon of ſin is wanting.</p>
                     <p>If thou wouldſt have good ground of the pardon of thy ſins, try thy ſelf by the former ſignes.</p>
                     <p>Having before heard of the effects of the life of our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> now we come to ſhew the effects of <hi>Sanctification.</hi> Now becauſe Sanctification is found partly in the heart, partly in the life of a Chriſtian, Firſt, I will ſhew you the effects of Sanctification in the heart. Whereſoever this Spirit of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſhed abroad, you ſhall finde variety of graces, ſo different and various, that in nature they could not ſtand together. There are in Chriſtians certain combinations of graces.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Look at grace as it firſt works in the converſion of a ſinner. When a man is firſt brought on to God, he is then taken up with two contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, with joy that God ſhould have ſuch mercy on him, and withall griefe and ſorrow for his ſins, whereby he hath offended ſo mercifull a God: as it was with the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> temporall Captivity, Pſal. 126.1, 2, 3. <hi>We were like them that dreamed, then were our mouths filled with laughter.</hi> They were out of themſelves, like men in a dream, they rejoyced at this their delivery, and yet the ſame people that rejoyced at this their delivery, yet in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn they went up mourning with weeping and ſupplication, for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:65998:202"/>
dealing with God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.4, 5. And ſuch a combination of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is there in a Chriſtian at his firſt converſion, he rejoyceth in his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; and yet never was there any ſo kindly mourning as a Chriſtian ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of Chriſts redemption and goodneſſe to him, in this caſe he mourns as a man that mourns for his firſt-born, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In the duties of Gods worſhip there is another combination of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that his joy and fear, Pſal. 2.11. <hi>Rejoyce before him with trembling,</hi> When grace is lively and ſtirring, a Chriſtian comes with holy fear and awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, &amp; yet none comes with more joy and holyneſſe. A dead hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian he comes very unwillingly, and holds back; but living Chriſtians are a willing people, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110.3. It's the joy of their hearts to do God any ſervice; and yet withall, never do Chriſtians go about any duties with more aweful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then when they come with moſt joy. In another thing thoſe affections do not concur. When a man goes joyfully about his buſineſſe, he goes not about it with trembling; or, if he goes trembling, he goes not rejoycing; But a Chriſtian, though he go about a duty with much fear, yet with much joy, Pſal. 130.4. <hi>There is mercy with thee that thou mayſt be feared.</hi> Exod. 15.11. <hi>God is fearful in praiſes.</hi> When the heart is moſt inlarged to praiſe God, then is it moſt awefull of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Take a godly man in tribulations, when he is moſt oppreſſed with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and made ſad and awefull by them, yet then is the heart moſt joyous. This was an argument of their ſincerity, 1 Theſſ. 1.6. <hi>Having received the Word in much affliction, and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now, naturally no affliction is joyous, and yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We rejoyce in tribulation,</hi> Rom. 5.3. A Chriſtian under ſore preſſures of Gods hand, that doth threſh them out of his husk, is not onely content, but joyfull; and that is above all nature.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 There is a mixture in his affections, in his dealing with men. In a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian you ſhall finde much patience, and yet without all forbearance; very patient, and yet by no means bearing with evil, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. This is the nature of ſpirituall patience; injuries put upon himſelfe, he endures with patience, but injuries againſt God, he will by no means bear.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 You ſhall find gentleneſſe and meekneſſe mixed with much auſterity and ſtiffneſſe. <hi>The wiſdome that is from above is peaceable and gentle,</hi> Numb. 12.3. <hi>Moſes</hi> was the meekeſt man upon the earth, yet the ſame <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo meek and gentle in his own cauſe, if it be in Gods cauſe, he is ſo ſtiffe that when the King would have the cattle left, he would not leave ſo much as an hoof at the Kings command, he is inflexible in Gods cauſe; even as the liquid air moſt eaſily yeelds to the leaſt fly, yet if God ſet it as a firmament, to ſeparate the waters above from the waters below, it ſtands like a wall of braſſe, it yeelds not, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lets it drop through by ſmall drops, as through a ſieve, but not to fall into a deluge: So, though a Chriſtian be as the liquid air, eaſie and gentle, apt to yeeld, yet in a cauſe of God, let there be never ſo great a maſſe preſſing on him, he ſtands ſtedfaſt and unmoveable.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 There is a modeſty mixt with magnanimity, a thing not eaſily found in moral virtues <hi>Paul</hi> looks at all his outward priviledges but as droſſe and dung in compariſon of Chriſt; a man that ſpeaks of himſelf, <hi>I am leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints,</hi> Eph. 3.8. though he were not inferiour to the chiefeſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. Yet this modeſt man, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.37. when the Magiſtrates had whipped him and his companions, and then when they had done, would have ſent them away; <hi>Nay,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but let them come and fetch us;</hi> ſee the magnanimity of his ſpirit, when his perſon, or calling, or cauſe is called in queſtion, in that caſe he will put forth himſelfe; deep modeſty and high mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity to meet in one man, at one time, in the ſame action, this is a work above nature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1, 2. You would think that ſuch a weaned childe as <hi>David</hi> was, ſhould not have an high thought or word in him; but he that was thus mean, and low, and thus weaned from earthly preferments, if you come to ſpeak of ſpirituall things, he looks at all worldly things as too mean for
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:65998:203"/>
him. Pſal. 24.7.9. <hi>Lift up your heads ye gates, and be ye lift up ye everlaſting doors,</hi> that is, let your hearts be lifted up to higher objects then the world can afford; his heart is weaned from the Kingdome and Crown, but to Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and grace, and the Kingdome of heaven; why, are not theſe of an higher nature then they? Yes, and yet in theſe matters his heart is in a kinde haughty, and his eyes lifted up, and he exerciſeth himſelfe in great matters; ſo that a Chriſtian hath not a baſe ſpirit, but an heart lifted up above the world, to the favour of God, and pardon of ſins, and an eternal Kingdome. Pſal. 149.6. <hi>Let the high praiſes of God be in their mouths,</hi> In the Or ginal, <hi>high things, great and mighty things of God, his mighty majeſty, and power, and glory and praiſe, let theſe be in your mouths.</hi> He would have a Chriſtians ſpirit filled with high thoughts, and his mouth with high words, high words and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full threatnings to binde Princes, the high promiſes and commands of God; nay, the high counſels of God, that are unſearchable, yet as far as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, a Chriſtian will be prying into them, yet with much modeſty and Chriſtian magnanimity, his ſpirit ſearcheh out the deep things of God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 There is another combination in a Chriſtian, buſie diligence in worldly affairs, and yet a dead heartedneſſe to the world. For a man to riſe early, and ſit up late, follow his work hard, take much pains, is not a thing to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.27. It's commended in the good Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, even the greateſt Princeſſe may not eat the bread of idleneſſe, then we ſee diligence in worldly buſineſſe may well ſtand with grace; but yet the ſame perſon muſt be dead to the world, his heart muſt be ſet on things above, theſe are not his life, that is <hi>laid up in Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3.1, 2, 3. His <hi>heart is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to the world,</hi> Gal. 6.14. Though his employment be in the world, yet his <hi>converſation is in heaven,</hi> Phil. 1.20. Prov. 6.5, 6. It's made a part of wiſdome to be as buſie Ants, gathering and laying up, but all the while his hands are there, his heart is in heaven; he doth things in obedience to God by the rule of his Word, and for his freedome in Gods ſervice, another may do the ſame work, with the ſame care and ſucceſſe, and yet the heart far unlike.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The love of our enemies is a particular virtue of Gods Saints, Matth. 5.45, to 47. Now this very grace hath in it contrary works in our heart, it's like fire, and water both; naturally our hearts are very cold, and hard, and frozen like ice towards our enemies, but Chriſt comes and thawes theſe froſtlings, and warms us with compaſſion towards them, that his heart often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mourns for them, to ſee them take ſuch unjuſt courſes againſt them who have not wronged them; and on the other ſide, whereas a naturall man if he ſee his enemy, he boyls in wrath and paſſion againſt him, love comes like a cool water and cools the heat of paſſion in our heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For application.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wouldſt thou know whether thou haſt life or no? Why, haſt thou found thy heart affected with joy for Gods goodneſſe to thee, and yet withall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſorrowfull for thy unkinde dealing with him? Theſe are certain evidences of the life of grace in thee. You may find many affected and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with the Word, as <hi>Herod</hi> was; but if this joy were of God, it would not vaniſh away like ſmoak, but would adminiſter ſo much the more ſorrow and mourning for ſin; though a Chriſtians joy may ſuddenly vaniſh, yet it alwayes leaves behinde an inward grieving for ſin, to keep poſſeſſion for it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 How do you finde your hearts affected to Gods worſhip? Do you finde your hearts generally unwilling to pray or hear? This is an ill ſigne. But if you finde your hearts willing, and the more willing, the more carefull withall. In this caſe there is life. But if a man have fear without joy, or joy without fear, the heart is not in a good temper.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="401" facs="tcp:65998:203"/>3. How doſt thou finde thy heart in tribulation? Doſt thou finde no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation ſupporting thee? This is an ill ſigne. But if thou findeſt with <hi>David,</hi> in the multitude of thy troubled thoughts, Gods comforts ſuſtain thy ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.18. in this caſe thou haſt life.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Obſerve your carriages, Doe you bear patiently with bad men, and yet not ſo patiently as to bear with evill? Patience and zeal muſt goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Are you of a meek, gentle, and flexible temper? Its well. But how are you in Gods cauſe? Are you there inflexible, and immovable, ſo that you will not abate an hooſe in Gods cauſe? Why, both theſe are a life of grace.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Thou ſayſt thou art modeſt, and thinkeſt meanly of thy ſelfe; I, but how is this grace coupled? for God ſends them two and two together, as he did his Diſciples, to ballance one another. Haſt thou withall a lofty ſpirit in the wayes of God, an heart lift up to heavenly things? Why, ſuch a ſpirit hath life. The moſt modeſt ſhould be moſt magnanimous.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Look at worldly buſineſſe, Canſt thou be diligent in thy calling? Why, this God requires. But how ſtands thy heart? Art thou buſie in the world, and yet thy heart dead to the world? This is a ſigne of true ſpirituall life.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. If we finde our hearts ſo abounding in love, that like fire it thawes our cold frozen affections; and again, like water, can cool our hot paſſionate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; why, this love is a fruit of faith, and a ſigne of life; its a ſigne our ſins are forgiven us, if we have hearts forgiving others.</p>
                     <p>Now we come to the effects of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> as they are expreſt in the life of a Chriſtian, and they are anſwerable to the effects of naturall life. The effects of naturall life are principally five.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>1. <hi>Motion.</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When a creature is able to move it ſelfe in its place, to thoſe duties of this or that life, its ſaid to live. If a thing move not but by others, its not alive; or if it move out of its place, its not alive, as a ſtone thrown up moves downward, and fire moves upward; but this is not properly life, but rather a deſire of reſt; and for things that move, they move according to the life they have; as, a tree a vegetative life, a beaſt a ſenſitive life, a man a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall life; but if a man have a ſpirituall motion in his proper place its a ſigne of ſpirituall life; ſometimes a man reacheth out of his place, reaching to higher matters, and more ambitious thoughts then his calling leads to, thoſe move not from an inward principle of grace, but from levity of heart; ſo the Phariſees, they moved to holy duties, but it was for credit, others for profit, for loaves, <hi>John</hi> 6.26. Its one thing to move to ſpirituall duties out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inclination and affection to them, another thing to move out of levity or deſire of eminency; it is one thing to move to them out of love, another thing to move to them out of reſpect, or credit, or profit. Why, this is but as the moving of a ſtone out of its naturall gravity. <hi>Abſolom</hi> had a marvellous affection to reign, and oh that he were King, every one ſhould have juſtice, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.13. But he was now out of his place, and therefore the thing he did, was but to attempt the cutting off his Fathers life; but that is life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly that moves in its place.</p>
                     <p>Again, a man may move in his place, and yet by an outward principle, as a clock moves by the weight that hangs on it: ſo a man may move to ſome duties of Religion by the weight of the Law, or authority hanging on him. Again, <hi>Jehu</hi> may move in his calling very buſily, and yet have no ſpirituall life; ſo it muſt be inquired whether the duty a man doth be ſpirituall or no. And a duty is ſpirituall,</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="402" facs="tcp:65998:204"/>1. When we are ſenſible of our inſufficiency, and therefore depend upon Chriſt, that thorough him we may doe all things.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When we have reſpect to the Word of God as our rule.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When we doe all for the glory of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>The life I now live, I live by faith in the Son of God.</hi> So far a man lives, as he denies his own ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and depends on Chriſt for aſſiſtance, and hath reſpect to Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements as his rule, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. and aimes at the glory of God as his end. <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.5, 6. <hi>When ye faſted, did ye faſt unto me at all?</hi> Did ye it to bring any ſervice or glory to me? Did ye it not for your ſelves, for your own ſafety and deliverance? Why, if we goe upon ſuch principles, we want life, till we be in Chriſt we detain all the graces we have in unrighteouſneſſe, to magnifie our ſelves, to bring about our own ends.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>May not a good Chriſtian have his heart ſo dead that he is unfit for prayer, or hearing, or any holy duty, that he is unwilling to pray at all or to receive the Sacrament at all? Will you ſay ſuch a ſoul is dead, becauſe unfit for motion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, there may fall ſuch a deadneſſe on the heart of a Chriſtian, as whereby he may be both unable and unwilling to good duties, to which God uſually leaves us, when we go about things in our own ſtrength, and grow ſelfe-ſure; but when by this God hath ſchooled us, and taught us thereby that all our life is hid in Chriſt; why, in this caſe God is wont to make us ſenſible of this ſinfull diſloyalty, and that in us <hi>dwells no good thing,</hi> that we of our ſelves are unable to doe any good duty, and for this diſtemper we mourn and grieve heartily. Why, this very ſence of deadneſſe is an act of ſpirituall life, which in time will work him to a farther dependence on Chriſt, and to be more heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Gods Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, and by how much the more we ſtrive thus, ſo much the more life we have.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond effect of life is feeding. This ſigne Chriſt gives, <hi>John</hi> 6.54. <hi>Whoſo eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life.</hi> This is not meant of the Sacrament, for it was not then inſtituted, but of Chriſt himſelfe; but when God hath inſtituted ordinances, this is a ſure ſigne of life, if in every ordinance we partake in, we feed on Chriſt, on his blood; he that feeds not, lives not, he that forbears his meat, and forbears it long, he cannot live. Indeed, for a time a mans ſtomach may be ſo diſtempered, that he cannot eat, but he recovers himſelfe and falls to his food.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>How ſhall we know whether we feed on Chriſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A.</hi> 1. Doe you finde an inward longing after Chriſt in every ordinance, that nothing will ſatisfie your ſoul but Chriſt, he is a ſweet ſavour to you; as an hungry man, give him ſilver and gold never ſo much, he is not ſatisfied unleſſe he have meat? It was an argument of life in the Spouſe, that ſhe ſought Chriſt diligently in every ordinance, and her ſoul was grieved becauſe ſhe found him not. If a man therefore come to the ordinances, and it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver troubles him though he goe home without Chriſt, this man feeds not on Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Feeding implies a finding of ſweetneſſe and reliſh in our meat: So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how doe you finde Chriſt, is he a ſweet ſavour to you? Doe you finde comfort and ſtrength in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, 16. Why, its a ſigne of life that you reliſh your meat well; nay, its a ſigne of health, for a ſick man cannot reliſh his meat; and if a Chriſtian finde no reliſh in the ordinances, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of it as his ſickneſſe, and looks up to God for help againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In all feeding there is a taking of the meat down, we doe not ſpit it out, and when it is down it muſt continue there, we muſt not caſt it out: So, if Gods Word abide in us, and we hide it in our ſouls by a wiſe applying of it to our ſouls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.11. and therefore give up your ſelves to be guarded by it, this is a ſigne of life and ſtrength.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All feeding implies a converſion of the aliment into the thing nouriſhed ſo that in time our meat is ſo digeſted that its turned into our own nature and this is more then receiving Chriſt by faith; for when we receive him, and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65998:204"/>
apply him to our ſelves, this is faith; but to be conformed to him in every thing, to be faſhioned according to his nature, this is a farther act of life. When a Chriſtian ſo feeds on Chriſt, that he is of the ſame nature with him, meek, lowly, and patient, as he was, this is a ſigne of life. When we are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into his nature by feeding on him, and he into ours; why, this very feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſpirituall food, implies a ſpirituall life: <hi>è contra,</hi> he that eats not the fleſh of Chriſt, hath not Chriſt; he means not a <hi>Cannibal</hi>-like eating of his very naturall body and blood; for if a man ſhould indeed eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and ſuck out his blood, it would profit him nothing, <hi>John</hi> 6.63. And this the <hi>Capernaites</hi> thought a monſtrous thing to eat the fleſh of Chriſt, therefore it is not the fleſh of Chriſt, but the Spirit that quickeneth and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth life.</p>
                     <p>A third effect of ſpirituall life is growth, that which lives grows, untill it comes to full maturity, and then it either ſtands at a ſtay, or begins to decay; but a ſpirituall life grows up to full perfection, and then it continues in that perfect eſtate for ever in heaven, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. &amp; 3.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. If a Chriſtian grows, he lives.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>Doth not many a Chriſtian ſtand at a ſtay, or oft-times go back, and loſe his firſt love and fruitfulneſſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, for a time he may, as a living man by ſickneſſe may loſe his ſtrength and vigour, and be made unfit for any employment, but if he ſtrive to recover himſelfe, its a ſigne of life: ſo a Chriſtian by ſome corrupt luſts may waſt his beſt graces, like a thiefe in a candle, but if he be a living Chriſtian, he ſtrives againſt them, and prays with <hi>David, O spare me a little, that I may recover my ſtrength, before I go hence, and be no more ſeen!</hi> If he find a decay, he conſiders from whence he is faln, and he recovers himſelfe, and doth his <hi>firſt works, Rev.</hi> 2.4. Repentance is the purge of the ſoul, it expells out evill luſts, and then we doe more at laſt then at firſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. So then, a Chriſtian is continually a growing, if not in the bulk of grace, yet in more ſweetneſſe, and mellowneſſe; as apples at their full bulk, yet grow more ripe and ſweet; ſo a Chriſtian, though he grow not to more tallneſſe, yet he may grow to more rootedneſſe in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In more ſweetneſſe of ſpirit, that is, in more love to his Brethren, and care of Gods glory.</p>
                     <p>A fourth effect of life is this, life hath an expulſive power to expell that which is noyſome and dangerous to it, it will caſt it out either by purging, or ſweat, or vomit, any noyſome humour is burdenſome to nature; ſo if grace be living, there is a power to expell every thing that is ſuperfluous, much more what is noyſome and hurtfull, nature keeps nothing but what it converts to its own nouriſhment; ſo a Chriſtian cuts away every ſuperfluity, if it be a thing of no purpoſe, or no uſe to his calling, though it may to others, this he abandons, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. But that knowledge which may be either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or expedient for him, that a Chriſtian retains, a Chriſtian caſts out that chiefly which is contrary to grace.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Doubtings, for that is contrary to the life of grace. 2. It caſts away all preſumption, and ſelfe-dependance, perfect love caſts out fear, and patience ſtrives againſt frowardneſſe, and every grace againſt its contrary, ſo that he may grow up to full holineſſe; the life of grace caſts out the life of the world, ſo much of the world as is cumberſome to his ſpirit, ſo much a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian lays down.</p>
                     <p>A fifth act of life is the begetting of his kind: nature grows up to this abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, though at firſt it be but weak; ſo grace no ſooner moves, or grows, or feeds in any meaſure, but it hath a minde to beget others; as ſoon as ever the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> began to be acquainted with Chriſt, ſhe ran to all her neighbors, and tells them ſhe had met with one that told her all that ever ſhe had done, <hi>Is not this the Chriſt? John</hi> 4.29. This is the nature of ſpirituall life, as ſoon as they are well begot themſelves, they are ready to beget others.

Indeed, a Chriſtian may hide himſelfe a while, but as ſoon as he is aſſured of life himſelfe, he propagates the ſame to others, <hi>John</hi> 1.41, to 46. When one Diſciple was called, he goes and calls another to come and ſee. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth that if God will but aſſure him of mercy, and eſtabliſh him therein, then he will teach others Gods ways, and ſinners ſhall be converted unto him, he that is once converted himſelfe, his care is to convert others to God.</p>
                     <p>Try your ſelves by theſe ſignes.</p>
                     <p>Doe you finde your ſelves moving a life of grace, growing up therein, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon Chriſt, expelling the enemies of life, and drawing on others to the ſame life? theſe are evident ſignes of life; if you finde it not thus, there is no true ſigne of the life of grace in you.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This life may be diſcerned by the properties of it, by finding of which we may diſcern of our ſpirituall life. And there are three principall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Where ever life is, there is ſome warmth. When <hi>Eliſha</hi> had ſtretched himſelfe over the dead childe, the fleſh of the dead childe began to wax warm, a ſigne of life, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.34. So the preſence of the Spirit united to the ſoul of man is the cauſe of all ſpiritual heat. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Fervent in spirit.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit is compared to <hi>fire, Mat.</hi> 3.11. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Quench not the Spirit.</hi> A ſigne that the Spirit is of a fervent nature. So 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. <hi>I put thee in remembrance to blow up the graces of Gods Spirit.</hi> A Metaphor taken from blowing up the fire with bellows; all which imply, that the Spirit of Chriſt communicated to Chriſtians is a fervent ſpirit. Where there is no warmth, there is no life. If our ſpirit begin to wax warm, its a ſigne of ſpirituall life; as the two Diſciples that went to <hi>Emaus</hi> ſaid, (<hi>Luke</hi> 22.32.) <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us whileſt he spake thoſe things?</hi> Implying the Word hath a power to quicken, and warm, and heat the ſpirit of a Chriſtian. This ſame warmth and heat is expreſt divers wayes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The very knowledge of a Chriſtian is warm, whereas in all others the knowledge is cold, and meerly ſpeculative, without any life or power. There is a zeal according to knowledge, and there is a knowledge according to zeal. The zeal that is not according to knowledge is a raſh vaine zeal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. So, it is a cold empty knowledge that hath not zeal with it. <hi>John</hi> was a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and a ſhining light, ſhewing every ſeverall condition what they ſhould doe, but he burnt up the hypocriſie and luſts of the body, and inflamed their affections with zeal and warmth, as <hi>Herod</hi> heard him gladly. Where there is truth of light and knowledge, there is burning. The knowledge of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian makes him fruitfull in a Chriſtian courſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. So that whatever he knows either neceſſary or expedient for him to doe, he will doe it, and he will cauſe others to doe their duties that belong unto him; ſuch is the heat of his ſpirit, that he will not ſuffer his Brother to lie in ſin, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. Now another man knows many things, but doth them not, nor thinks he is bound to doe them; but a Chriſtians knowledge is of that nature that it will not ſuffer him or his Brother to lie in any ſin. True Chriſtians are thought oft-times to be more buſie then needs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is warmth in our breath; as long as there is life in us there is breath, and that breath is warm; ſo if there be any ſpirituall life, there is alwayes ſome warm breathing, ſome warmth in his breathing towards God, there is alwayes ſome warmth in his prayers, the prayers of hypocrites are but cold, and empty, and vaniſh away, but there is alwayes ſome breath of life in a good mans prayers, even then when we know not what to pray for, or how to pray, yet then there is alwayes ſomething in him that expreſſeth warmth, his very ſighings and groans come from ſome kinde of heat and life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As their breathing towards God is warm, ſo they breath warmth one towards another, ſo that in their conference, if they ſpeak of the things
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:65998:205"/>
of the Word, they doe not ſpeak ſlightly, and overly without any affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but they ſpeak of them with reverence, and fear, and love, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is that kinde of warmth in him, as that thereby he doth not onely affect the Word, but he is able to digeſt it in ſome meaſure; there is no life, but there is ſome power to digeſt ſomething, if not ſtrong meat, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20. <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the longing it hath to thy judgements.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>My ſoul panteth after thee.</hi> This very panting and breathing of the ſoul after God, ſo unites the ſoul unto God, that thereby he digeſts ſomething that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables him to walk before God in the land of the living, whereas an hypocrite is hopeleſſe to any good.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If things be warm, the more they lye together the more warmth and heat; cold logs laid together heat not one another, but two or three brands put together are enough to kindle an heap of wood: ſo take a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that is very cold, and almoſt benummed, yet put him to two or three more, and one word kindles another, and their ſpirits are more and more inflamed, more fit to pray, and fitter to admoniſh, and comfort, and help forward one another, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. Fervent love among Brethren ſo kindles one another that they are inflamed to any good offices; but when Chriſtians are disjoynted they loſe all their heat, as when a man means to put out the fire, he layes one brand from another, a ſigne he means to goe to bed and ſleep; ſo when Satan would put out the life and heat of grace in a Family or Town, he disjoynts Chriſtians, and ſo they fall into ſecurity, and grow dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, all their heat is quite extinguiſhed. Therefore the Apoſtle exhorts us not to forſake the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>See that ye love one another, with pure hearts fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>If this heat be alwayes found where life is, how comes it to paſſe that the hearts of Chriſtians are ſo cold and dead? How comes a Chriſtian to be ſo unprofitable if he digeſt the Word? Doe not Chriſtians meet and afford little warmth and help one to another?</hi> Luke 24.32. <hi>The two diſciples hearts burned when Chriſt talked with them, a ſigne before he came and chafed them up, they were cold and dead-hearted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> True Chriſtians oft-times finde a marvellous coldneſſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummedneſſe of heart, that they finde little warmth in their breathing, in their prayers or conferences, and this comes partly from want of ſupply of new fuell, when they walk in their own ſtrength, without looking up to Chriſt for new ſupply; and partly by pouring cold water upon it, that is, ſome noyſome luſts that put out the grace of God, or elſe the uſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts with wordly hearts, theſe caſt cold water on the fire, as the fire is put out either by withdrawing the fuell, or by caſting water on it: But yet though this be their fault, yet even then when they want chafing and heat, there is ſome ſtriving in them, which argues life, ſo much life as in them, ſo much heat. As for thoſe two Diſciples that went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> though their hearts burned whileſt Chriſt ſpake, yet before Chriſt came, they were talking of Chriſt, and of his ſufferings, which made them ſad, then Chriſt comes and puts life, <hi>O fools and ſlow of heart to believe;</hi> This blew up the ſparks in them. So much as a Chriſtian hath loſt of his heat, ſo much of his life, if his warmth be ſmothered his life is ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</p>
                     <p>Now this warmth is ſometimes expreſt in ſad looks, and pantings, and deep ſighs, and groanings and mourning for his forlorn eſtate, and ſurely there is life in that, for in griefe the heat runs to the heart. But worſe then this, a Chriſtian ſometimes vaniſheth away in much frothy emptyneſſe, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly rejoycing in worldly comforts, when there is no life within. <hi>Peter</hi> when he denyed his Maſter, his heart was fill'd with griefe and ſorrow, and he
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:65998:206"/>
went out and wept bitterly. But what ſay you to <hi>David,</hi> when he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery, how did he go on from one ſin to another? He can make <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> drunk, and then kill him, and then make no matter of it, he is careleſſe in all this, as if he had quite loſt all life and affection to God, there was not the leaſt beating of the pulſe of a Chriſtian, ſuch a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that a man that knew him not before, might have written in his forehead, <hi>a man forſaken of God,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any life of grace in him, Where now was <hi>Davids</hi> life? None ſo far gone as he; 'tis a queſtion whether he prayed or no all this while; as ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have ſo loſt themſelves, as for three years together they have not prayed at all, as doubting of any acceptance, becauſe they were ſo ſinfull, yet there is ſome habit of grace, but hardly one act of life; yet ſtill this holds true, ſo much warmth ſo much life, as by the Almighty power of God, there may be fire and yet no heat; as the fiery furnace, though made ſeven times hotter then ordinary, yet God ſo reſtrained the act, that it did not ſo much as ſinge the garments of the three children that were caſt into it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. So <hi>è contra,</hi> there is a marvellous helliſh power in ſin, ſo as it will ſuſpend all the acts of grace, ſo as a Chriſtian may expreſſe no acts of grace, but lye as a man in a deep ſwound, without life and motion, that can be diſcerned, and yet this you ſhall finde in a Chriſtian at ſuch times, a liſtleſneſſe of his heart to ſin, that he cannot break out into ſin with all his ſtrength and power as he did in his naturall condition; and the ground is this, becauſe there is ſtill fleſh and ſpirit in him, ſo that as the ſpirit cannot doe what good it would, ſo the fleſh cannot doe that evill it would, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. And when a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is moſt lively, yet there is ſtill ſome faintneſſe and weakneſſe in him; ſo <hi>è contra,</hi> when grace is moſt weak and corruption moſt ſtrong, yet he cannot commit ſin with all his ſtrength as formerly he hath done, but he goes about ſin unwillingly, not with the full ſway that he was wont to doe, he goes liſtleſly about it.</p>
                     <p>Try your ſelves therefore by theſe ſignes, if thou haſt Chriſt, thou haſt life? if life, thou haſt warmth and heat; look to thy knowledge, doth it puffe thee up, and not edifie? Doſt thou magnifie thy ſelfe by it? If it be lively knowledge, it is joyned with zeal, as Chriſt revealed himſelfe to the Church of <hi>Thyatira, Rev.</hi> 2.18. Thus ſaith the Son of God, whoſe eyes are like flames of fire, writing to the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> that was warm in love, and growing up therein, he revealed himſelfe according to the ſtate of the Church, as having eyes like flames of fire, as that Church had zeal with her light; ſo that if thou haſt a true knowledge, thy eyes are like flames of fire, what thou knoweſt thou doſt with zeal and fervency of ſpirit, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>We cannot but speak the things which we have ſeen and heard;</hi> that is, which we have certain knowledge of, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.20. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.9.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Conſider therefore whether thy knowledge be joyned with zeal: How doſt thou breath? doſt thou ſmell a ſweet ſavour in the Word? Then there is breath in thy noſtrills.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Doſt thou breath warmth in prayer, pant and ſigh after God? In thy conference, doſt thou expreſſe life and heat? Then thou art a living Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. How doſt thou finde thy ſtomach to the Word? doſt thou reliſh it, or elſe art thou aſhamed of thy unprofitableneſſe? Then there is life.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Doſt thou love to be disjoynted from thy Brethren, like brands caſt one from another? Then there is no life. Life loves to preſerve it ſelfe; if you ſit looſe one from another all heat and life goes out, religion ceaſeth, there is a bidding farewell to all Chriſtian duties; but if you ſee bone joyn to bone, one gather to another, then you ſhall ſee fleſh and ſinews will cover them, and life will come in, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.7. Put brands together, and there will be ſome fire and heat propagated.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="407" facs="tcp:65998:206"/>2. A ſecond property of life. Where life is, there is ſome plyableneſſe and flexibleneſſe, a dead carkaſe is always ſtiffe: So conſider whether you be ſtiffe or no; why, if there be life of grace in you, <hi>That wiſdome that is from above, is gentle, and eaſie to be entreated,</hi> James 3.17.</p>
                     <p>There are four things in this plyableneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He is eaſily pleaſed with any indifferent indevours, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. A gracious man is eaſily pleaſed; if a man be froward and hard to pleaſe, its a ſigne ſuch a ſoul is ſtiffe and dead.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If he be offended, he is eaſie to be entreated, <hi>James</hi> 3.17. Its a ſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of a reprobate ſence to be implacable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If he have offended another, he is willing to yeeld to that man whom he hath offended; ſo much ſtiffneſſe, ſo much deadneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There is this gentleneſſe in every living Chriſtian, he is willing to deny himſelfe upon unequall terms, when he might ſtand upon his right, yet he yeelds his right, rather then any offence ſhould grow; ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> did to <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 13.8, 9. If we finde it thus, we are loving Chriſtians; but if men be hardly pleaſed, like <hi>Nabal,</hi> churliſh, hardly recall'd, will not yeeld, but ſtand upon their right to the utmoſt, then they are in a deep ſwound, or dead.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whileſt the body is alive, its ſavoury, a dead carkaſe is very unſavoury; mark your ſpirits, every living Chriſtian is a ſweet ſavour to God, his words are ſavoury, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.5, 6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.29. His works ſavour well in the noſtrills of God and man, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.10. But if your ſpeeches and carriages be unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, uncomely, and profane, are ye not then carnall? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. But a good Chriſtian ſo carryes himſelfe, that the bowells of the Saints are refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. Unſavoury ſpeeches and carriages argue the deadneſſe of ſuch a ſoul.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. May ſhew us the dangerous and uncomfortable condition of every ſuch ſoul that hath not Chriſt; <hi>He that hath not the Son, hath not life.</hi> If we be without Chriſt, we are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 5. We may ſay of men by nature, as was ſaid of <hi>Senacheribs</hi> hoſt, <hi>Behold ye are all dead carkaſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35. We by nature have not this act of life.</p>
                     <p>Five acts of life we heard of before, by Nature we are wanting in them all.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By Nature we have no ſpirituall motion, all our works are but dead works, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 9.14. And ſo dead are we by Nature that we doe no good; nay, we can doe no good; and, which is worſt of all, we will doe no good. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. <hi>There is none that doth good, no not one. All the imaginations of our hearts</hi> by nature, <hi>are wholly evill, and that continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5. And as all his thoughts are evill, ſo are all his words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.33. And ſo are all his works, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.18. We are as rotten trees, we cannot bring forth one good fruit. There is not ſo much in a naturall man, as one good thought, or word, or action, that proceeds from faith, or is regulated by Gods Word, or aymes at Gods glory; nay, if God ſhould raiſe us up, and inable us to doe good, yet we would not. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. <hi>ult. Oh Jeruſalem! wilt thou not be made clean? When ſhall it once be?</hi> The man that had a bodily diſeaſe on him, when Chriſt askt him, <hi>Wilt thou be made whole?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Yea Lord.</hi> But if God ask us the queſtion, Wilt thou be made clean? we refuſe it. We finde ſhifts to put off Chriſt, never could we finde that day, wherein we could ſay, This day I would be a Chriſtian, but we are either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt perſwaded to be Chriſtians, or elſe it muſt not be this day; as bad debtors, they would not have the creditors ſet them a day, leſt they
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:65998:207"/>
ſhould break it; ſo wee would be ſpared from ſetting God a day, for ſurely we would break it; indeed, when we are preſſed with ſome fore ſickneſſe, indangering death, what ſay we? O! If God would but once reſtore me to health againe, all the world ſhould ſee I would become a new man, and yet when he was in health, he ſaid, I will ſeek God, and turne to him in ſickneſſe; and thus we put God off from Winter to Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, from Spring to Harveſt; when we are ſick, we promiſe amendment, if God will ſend us health; but why not now? Doe you know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever you ſhall have health or no? And will you hazard your ſoules? And therefore God expects that in afflictions we ſhould ſeek him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They feed not on Chriſt, which was a ſigne of life, but as God ſaid of his ſuperſtitious people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20. the ſame may be ſaid of every naturall man, <hi>He feedeth upon aſhes, a deceitfull heart hath turned him aſide, that he cannot deliver his ſoule, nor ſay, Is there not a lye in my right hand?</hi> Every naturall man hath an idoll that he ſets up in his heart, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be that feeds not on the living God, feeds upon aſhes. It is taken from children, that for ſome evill humour, delight to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>bling upon aſhes and coals: So every naturall man he feeds upon aſhes, that is, upon dry and unſavoury meat that will not profit the ſoule, for the ſoul is ſpirituall and fed upon ſpirituall food; profits, and pleaſures, and honours are no more fit meat for the ſoul, then aſhes for the body. <hi>Solomon</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of the vanity of mankinde, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Who knoweth the spirit of a man that goeth upward, or the spirit of a beaſt that goeth downward?</hi> Who knows? Who conſiders, or takes it to heart, that his ſoule goes to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place then the beaſt? Who provides better for his ſoul then the beaſts? Doe not they all feed on worldly comfort who ſhould feed on immortall food? We by nature all of us feed on aſhes, ſo that we cannot deliver our ſoules, and ſay, Is there not a lye in my hand? Is not this a falſe courſe, a lying vanity? Will not profits and honours deceive me? <hi>A ſeduced heart hath deceived him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third act of ſpirituall life is growth. Now a carnall man is far from growing in grace; apt is he to grow in ſin, to proceed on in evill, to increaſe in ungodlineſſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 9.3. From coveteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ambition, from ambition to voluptuouſneſſe, this is his beſt growth.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A fourth act of life was expulſion of noyſome luſts. Now by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are loath to part with our luſts. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. <hi>O Jeruſalem! waſh thy heart from wickedneſſe, how long ſhall vain thoughts lodge in thee?</hi> We by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will never cleanſe out our luſts, but if we doe caſt out any thing, its the motions of Gods Spirit, we think them ſuperfluous and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and hinderers of our credit and pleaſures, ſo that all good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and good counſells that have been put in us, we caſt them out. <hi>Ahab</hi> is ſtruck with fear and humiliation, but he caſts out all by calling a Councell for War; Let <hi>Cain</hi> have a good motion, he puts it off by building a City, and ſo takes off his thoughts from once ſeeking to God to heal his ſins. <hi>Felix,</hi> when <hi>Pauls</hi> words made him to tremble, he would hear him no more at that time, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. As <hi>Paul</hi> complains of the <hi>Jewes, Acts</hi> 13.46. And <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 7.52. <hi>Ye ſtiffe-necked and uncircumciſed in heart, ye have alwayes reſiſted the holy Ghoſt.</hi> They are not well till they have caſt out all ſuch thoughts; we are not well, till we are alive to run from God; wiſe are we to doe evill, but to doe good we have no knowledge, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.22.</p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="409" facs="tcp:65998:207"/>5 A fifth act of life was begetting men to grace, but we <hi>è contra</hi> endeavour to beget them to the devil, and make them ſeven times more the children of the devill then before, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.15. Though we underſtand that chiefly of corrupt Teachers, yet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaketh it of all men by nature, Jer. 6.28. <hi>They are all corrupters;</hi> not onely bad themſelves, but corrupters of others, none that comes amongſt them but is made worſe by them, kept off farther from God, they would not have their friends, look towards matters of Religion. <hi>All fleſh have corrupted their wayes,</hi> Gen. 6.11.</p>

                     <p>This is evident not onely in the Text, but ſundry other places of the Epiſtle, cap. 1.4. He wrote it to ſuch, as by reading this Epiſtle might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to full joy. This is evident likewiſe by recounting the ſeveral ſorts of perſons to whom he wrote, <hi>cap.</hi> 1.12, 13, 14.

All his writings were directed to believers; ſo were all the Epiſtles of the reſt of the Apoſtles, directed to believers, to Saints, to the choſen of God, to their brethren, as will appear in all their firſt greetings; when our Saviour himſelf wrote, he wrote to ſuch in whom he acknowledged many ſpecial graces, yea even in the worſt of them, in the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> he acknowledged that ſhe had a few names. Now this gives us juſt occaſion to enquire; Why they were written to believers? 2 Why to them only.</p>
                     <p>To Believers, 1. In regard of the ſpecial help, and benefit their writings afford the Church; the benefits of their writing to the Church, were 1 Teaching, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.2. 2 Putting them in remembrance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22, 23. 3 Stirring them up to practice what they knew, 2 Pet. 1.2, 3. 4 To humble the ſpirits of them that were puft up, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 8. 5 That they might be ſtrengthned in their faith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13. 6 That their hearts might be filled with joy, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.4. which was effected, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.31. 7 Theſe writings have bin the foundation of the faith of all Chriſtians to the end of the world, becauſe they have afforded matter of all the preaching of the Miniſters, for by them the men of God are fully furniſhed, and made perfect to every good work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16, 17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 He writes to believers only, the reaſon is taken from the little uſe or profit that unbelievers will make of theſe writings, till they be brought on to believe, which is ſo little, that not one of the Apoſtles directs any of their writings to them, but only for the believers ſake, amongſt them; it's with the Apoſtles writings, as with propheſies, and not miracles; Propheſies are not for them that believe not, but for them that believe; Miracles are not for them that believe, but for them that believe not; not but that Miracles may confirm believers; but believers ſhould chiefly attend to Propheſies.

For ſuch Chriſtians as are doubtful of their eſtate, above all the writings of the Apoſtle read this Epſtile, it was the main ſcope of St. <hi>John,</hi> in this Epiſtle, that their joy might be full, and that they might know they had eternal life, here you ſhall finde a good ground-work of your good eſtate.</p>

To teach all believers to know what they have profited by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: it's an uſual thing to content our ſelves, if we do but read a chapter, and pray every morning, and our conſcience is not ſatisfied if we omit it, but a man may read and pray, and yet get no good, but if you would read pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, ſo read <hi>that you may know that you have eternal life,</hi> &amp; when you have ſo

                     <p>This verſe declares a double end of St. <hi>Johns</hi> writing this Epiſtle, one was, that believers might know they have eternal life, of which before; the ſecond end was, <hi>That they might believe on the Name of the Son of God.</hi>

For though believing be already wrought, yet they that do believe had need to believe more, the Word is the mighty power of God to lead believers from faith to faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. that is, from one degree of faith to another, Phil 1.25 as that is not only faith, but increaſe of faith, ſo 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10. there is not any of Gods ſervants, even the moſt exemplary Chriſtians, but there is ſome defect in their faith, which had need to be ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this may be the firſt reaſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Taken from the defects that are found in believers, the ſupply whereof they had need to increaſe and grow up to. 1 They had need to grow up to the belief of ſome principles which they believed not before, and this is a defect in the objects of faith; many of the Apoſtles believed not the Reſurrection of Chriſt; nay <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid, he ſhould not believe, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he ſhould ſee the print of his nayles,</hi> John 20.25. So many of the <hi>Corinths</hi> believed not the Reſurrection from the dead, a main Article of Faith: the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> lacked this in their Faith, they thought Chriſt would then have come ſuddenly, and therefore began to lay aſide all care in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward callings, which <hi>Paul</hi> informs them in, 2 Theſſ. 2. The <hi>Galatians</hi> are wanting in believing juſtification by faith, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> writes that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is ſomething wanting in the habit, or in the grace of faith, therefore the Apoſtle prays for the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that they might be rooted and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the faith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7. even as a young plant may be ſo weak, that the leaſt rub may root it up; ſo a Chriſtian may have ſome rooting in Chriſt, and yet want ſound rootedneſſe and firmneſſe of faith, there may be a want of that confidence and full aſſurance that is required.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Faith may be wanting in the ſenſe of it, for a Chriſtian may have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a great meaſure of lively faith, and yet be in doubt whether he have any true faith or not; now that we may be aſſured of it, he had need to be built up in faith; as the poor man ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Lord I believe, help mine unbelief,</hi> he believed, and yet knew not well whether he ſhould call it faith, or unbelief, therefore Phil. 1.25. <hi>Paul</hi> truſted that he ſhould continue with them for the furtherance and joy of their faith; now ſo long as a Chriſtian is doubtful of his faith, he hath little joy or comfort in it, therefore they had need to be brought on further, that their faith may be a joyful faith.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Faith had need to be increaſed in regard of the acts of it, which are perſwaſion and truſt on Chriſt, thoſe had need to be increaſed. <hi>Peter</hi> when he walked on the water, he was perſwaded Chriſt would ſave him, but when the winds began to be boyſterous, he was afraid and began to ſink, but Chriſt reacheth forth his hand to help him, and reproves him, <hi>O thou of little faith,</hi> Matth. 14.30, 31. The two Diſciples that went to <hi>Emaus,</hi> and were talking of Chriſts death, they ſaid one to another, <hi>We truſted it had been he that ſhould have delivered Iſrael,</hi> we ſo truſted, but now are afraid we are deceived, for they looked that the Meſſias ſhould abide for ever, but what ſaith Chriſt to them? <hi>O fools and ſlow of heart to believe,</hi> ſo that faith had need to increaſe in the acts of it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Faith had need to grow in the fruits of it, though faith may be of ſome ſtrength and comfort, yet it may be much wanting in the fruits of it; one fruit of faith is love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. Now a Chriſtian may leave his firſt love, and ſo far, that withall he may loſe his firſt works, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.2, 3. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <p>Q <hi>What is it to pray according to Gods will?</hi> Theſe two things it holds forth at the firſt view,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When we pray for ſuch things as are agreeable to Gods will, <hi>viz.</hi> his revealed will, we ſhould ask nothing but what he commands us. In the Lords prayer Chriſt tels us what he would have us pray for, for thoſe things we have warrant to pray.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What ever we ask, we ought to ask with ſubmiſſion of our wills to Gods will. So did Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> But for further inlargement.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A man is ſaid to pray according to Gods will, partly as his will is expreſt in his word, and partly as his will is revealed in our hearts.</p>
                     <p>For the will of God expreſt in his Word.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. God requires that we ſhould ask for nothing but what he commands us to doe, and therefore had need to pray for; whatever duty God requires of us, that we are to pray for. So did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.4, 5.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Whatſoever we pray for, God commands us to ask it in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.22, 23, 24.</p>
                     <p>To ask in the Name of Chriſt requires two graces of us, <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Humility of ſpirit in prayer is expreſt in four acts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We acknowledge our ſelves leſſe then the leaſt of Gods mercies, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. So that if God ſhould grant him nothing, he would juſtifie God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Another act of Humility, is to pray in ſenſe of our inſufficiency to think a good thought, much more to pray according to Gods will, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A man prayes in Humility, when he doth not deſire God to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any of his ſinfull luſts, but that Gods will may be done, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. verſ. 39.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To pray in Humility, is to make mention of no mediation in our prayers, but onely of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. They made a ſhew of Humility, as not being ſo bold as to have immediate acceſſe to God, therefore put up their prayers through the mediation of ſome Angell; but to goe lower then God allows, is but pride of heart.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To pray in the Name of Chriſt, is to pray in Faith. Which is expreſt in four acts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Faith directs us to put up our prayers onely to him on whom we believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. But we believe only in God, therefore neither Saints, nor Angels, nor the Mother of Chriſt, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> are to be prayed to, but we are to pray to our Father onely, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5, 6. Rom. 8.15.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith makes us come with ſome child like confidence to God as our Father.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By Faith we come to God as our heavenly Father in Chriſt, and well affected to Chriſt, as loving us himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.36.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We come to him as a Father Almighty, full of goodneſſe, readyer to give then we to ask.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third act of faith is, for a man to come truly cleaving unto Chriſt, not ſtanding in demurre, whether we had beſt leave our luſts or no, whether we had beſt become altogether Chriſtians or no. This wavering cannot ſtand with faith, for it's ſuch a wavering as whereby he is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a <hi>double-hearted man,</hi> an heart for God, and an heart for the world; ſometimes for God, ſometimes for his own luſts. Let not this man think he ſhall receive any thing. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. A fourth act of faith, is to believe that what we have asked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods will, he will certainly grant, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.24. So far as you have asked with ſubmiſſion to his will, ſo far will he grant according to your
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:65998:212"/>
wills, and though he deferre, yet make account your prayers are heard, that he will either grant what you ask, or what he knows will be better for you, and as welcome to you, for God looks not ſo much at the petition as at the end you aim at in opportuning ſuch a bleſſing, and that he will grant even when he ſeems to deny us our petitions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5 9. Chriſt was heard in that he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. Why, how was he heard? did he not drink of the cup he prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt? Yes, yet he was heard:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Chriſts will was that his Fathers will might be fulfilled, not his; in this he was heard.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's ſaid he was heard in that he feared, though he did drink of the cup, yet he was ſaved from thoſe fears and terrors that overwhelmed him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The main end of Chriſt was, that his Church might be redeemed, which God granted; ſo God granted the end of his petition, though not the thing it ſelf. So <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed earneſtly that he might goe over and ſee the good Land, God told him he ſhould not goe over, yet God let him ſee that good Land as well as if he had gone over. If we ſubmit our wills to Gods will, and pray in humility and faith, make account God ſeriouſly ponders the aime of your hearts in begging ſuch a mercy, and though he ſeems to croſſe ſuch your petitions, and to delay them, yet he knows how to grant the end of your petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by other means then you conceive, even then when God is diſpleaſed with our weake and unworthy prayers, as he was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 3.22, to 28 Yet then he knows how to grant what we aimed at. And this magnifies the name of Chriſt, that though in our own name we ſhould never find acceptance yet in Chriſts name he will grant our petitions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We pray according to the will of God, when we pray according to his will revealed in our hearts, <hi>in the ſpirit of him that prayes,</hi> Jude v. 20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. Now we pray according to Gods will revealed in the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When the Spirit raiſeth our hearts to reach forth ſenſibly with long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and breathings after the bleſſings we want. Thus <hi>Hannah</hi> poured forth her ſoul unto God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15. She expreſt not ſo much in words, as in the reaching and breathing of her ſpirit after the bleſſing ſhe prayed for. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.9. <hi>With my ſoul within me have I deſired thee;</hi> as if there were ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit in his ſpirit. When we pray in a further meaſure of ſtrength then our own hearts could reach to, ſuch a prayer is of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When we pray with fervency and earneſtneſſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. This is that which is called wreſtling and ſtriving with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. When our hearts are ſo ſet on Gods favour, as they will not let goe, till we have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Gen. 32.10, &amp; 24, 25, 26. expounded, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We pray in the Spirit, when we perſevere in praying and are impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1, to 10. This is expreſſed by the importunity of the Widow that prevailed with the unjuſt Judge: Shall a ſinfull Judge, a mortall man be prevailed with by the importunity of a poor Widow, and will not God much more avenge his elect that cry to him day and night? You may think God regards not your prayers, but the poor Widow did not more trouble this Judge, then God is troubled with your prayers, ſo that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſt untill he have fulfilled your deſires. To the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.5, to 11. Though God ſeem to be aſleep, yet if you continue knocking, God will open unto you; therefore when you have a good petition in hand, never give over but pray continually, and watch thereunto, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. till he anſwer. To what end doth he call it knocking, but to imply that our prayers make as much noyſe in heaven, as men doe by knocking at our doores? <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7: So the woman of <hi>Syrophaenicia,</hi> ſhe knocked and continued knocking, and would not have a denyall, ſo that Chriſt anſwers her, <hi>O woman! great is thy faith, be it unto thee as thou wilt:</hi> As if he were overwreſtled by her importunity, to grant her petitions.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe when we pray according to the will of God, in the Name of Chriſt, our prayer is Chriſts prayer; as if you ſend a childe or ſervant to a friend for any thing in your name, the requeſt is yours, and he that denyes your childe or ſervant in this caſe, denyes you; ſo no more can God deny a prayer put up in Chriſts name, then he can deny Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23, 24.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. From the interceſſion of the Spirit in ſuch a prayer; no prayer put up in the manner aforeſaid, but is the prayer of the holy Ghoſt, and God knows the meaning of his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. God knows our prayers would be weake and cold, except there were another Spirit beſides our own; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he diſcern his own Spirit in our prayers, he cannot deny his Spirit; nay further, as the Spirit makes interceſſion for us, ſo Chriſt himſelfe prayes for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. He takes up all our prayers for us as the great Maſter of requeſts, and he doth ſo perfume them, and take out all weakneſſe out of them, that he preſents them as a ſweet odour to God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. Even as if a younger Brother ſhould goe and gather a Poſie for his Father, he out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance gathers many weeds withall, but his elder Brother takes it, and pulls out all the weeds, and perfumes the flowers with ſweet water, and then preſents it to his Father in his Brothers name: ſo Chriſt ſees many ſinfull weakneſſes in our prayers, but he takes away all unſavourineſſe, and perfumes them, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them to God, and he accepts them.</p>

                     <p>How do theſe two great benefits, confidence and knowledge of granting our prayers, ſpring from what St. <hi>John</hi> hath written in this Epiſtle?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Five things concur to this confidence, and all of them inſiſted upon by St. <hi>John</hi> in this Epiſtle.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="420" facs="tcp:65998:213"/>1. Our adoption expreſt by St. <hi>John,</hi> ch. 3.1. He wonders at the admirable love of God, not only indebaſing of himſelfe to behold things here below, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.4, to 8. but in looking on us poor earth-wormes, and raiſing us up to be Sons and daughters to God: So that this is the firſt ground of our confidence in prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> our adoption, that we are Sons of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5, 6. Rom. 8.15. To whom may a Son come more boldly then to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And what aſſures him more of the grant of his petitions, then that he is his Son?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſts advocation breeds confidence in us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. Chriſt pleads with his Father on our behalfe for the hearing our petitions, and for the granting of what we want. An Advocate puts the petition, that it may be was rudely drawn by a man, into a form of Law, and ſo it holds currant in Law; ſo doth Chriſt with our prayers, he puts them into a right form and ſo pleads for us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The atonement or propitiation of Chriſt, is another cauſe of confidence, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. So that whereas many a Chriſtian may be afraid that his prayers ſhall never be heard, he is ſo ſinfull and unclean; <hi>Why,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>John) If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> He is not onely an Advocate but a propitiation, to make atonement for our ſins, that they ſhall not hinder our acceptance.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The anoyntment of the Spirit, whereby we know all things, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. is a ground of much confidence, that though we be blind and dull, and know not what God doth for us in our prayers, or how they ſpeed in heaven; why, Chriſt like an Advocate ſends down his Spirit, and lets us know how all things ſpeed. <hi>This unction teacheth us all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.12.</p>
                     <p>Q. <hi>How doth the Spirit certifie us of the hearing of our petitions?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. By helping us to pray; for we know our own hearts are dead and ſtraight, not able to put up any good prayer, if therefore the Spirit come like oyl, and make us pray affectionately, and ſenſibly, we know a prayer well made cannot ſpeed ill, a prayer made by Gods Spirit cannot but be heard, for God knows the meaning of his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This Spirit puts in us a perſwaſion of faith, that what we pray for God will anſwer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.23, 24. And ſo God gives us an <hi>Amen</hi> in our hearts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.8. <hi>David</hi> was in a ſore tryall and affliction, he prayes to God then, Verſ. 8. <hi>Away from me all ye workers of iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voyce of my weeping.</hi> In the midſt of his mourning, this unction fills him with a perſwaſion of the granting of his prayers; and ſo God often times ſatisfies the heart of a Chriſtian with this perſwaſion. <hi>Hannah</hi> when ſhe had poured out her ſpirit before God, and <hi>Eli</hi> had ſaid to her, <hi>The Lord grant thy petition thou askeſt of him:</hi> Why, ſhe took this as a voyce from heaven, and ſo ſhe went away comfortably, and ſhe feared that petition no more, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.16, 17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is another act of faith beſides perſwaſion, and that is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant wreſtling againſt all diſcouragements which come betwixt us and our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; famous is that example of the woman of <hi>Syrophaenicia,</hi> Matth. 15, 26, 27, 28. If the holy Ghoſt doth but give us ſo much reſolution, as not to be overwearyed with d fficulties, then <hi>Be it unto thee thou wilt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. This Spirit works as a Spirit of hope, and this ſtirs us up to wait patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on God, till he anſwer; our carnall ſpirits would be ready to ſay, <hi>Wherefore ſhould I wait on the Lord any longer,</hi> as that wicked King did, but now a ſpirit of hope waits on God, till God ſhall give an anſwer of peace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. Pſal. 130. 2 laſt verſ. When God gives us ſpirits to wait on him, he ſeals up unto us the grant of our petitions. A wiſe Prince if a petition be put up that is lawfull and he bid me wait for it, I count it granted: ſo if I put up a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and God give me an heart to wait for it, I make account he will grant it.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="421" facs="tcp:65998:213"/>4. This Spirit is a Spirit of fear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9. Doſt thou walk in thy Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an courſe depending upon Chriſt, reverencing his name and Ordinances? Why, <hi>God will fulfill the deſires of them that fear him,</hi> Jer. 32.40. And ſo he keeps covenant with us. If God give us an awefull reverent heart, that keeps us from departing from God, and God from departing from us, then the Lord will be neer when we call upon him, and this is from the unction of the Spirit which make us profit in all our wayes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2, 3.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. This is a Spirit of obedience, and that gives us good aſſurance of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our petitions, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21. For as we hearken to God, ſo God hearkens to us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.9. <hi>He that turneth away his ear from hearing the Law, his prayer ſhall be abominable.</hi> But if you hearken to God, God will hearken to you, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.7. If we ſay, <hi>Speake Lord, for thy ſervant heareth,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.5. then what we ſpeake God will hear. An obedient Chriſtian is a powerfull petitioner, mighty in prayer.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. From the root of confidence, which ſprings partly from Gods nature, partly from faith in Chriſt, partly from the unction of the Spirit; now for thoſe things we ſee many promiſes belong to us, our adoption aſſures us of Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he is a mercifull Father; our Father aſſures us that Chriſt is our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate; the unction of the Spirit breeds in us experience that we have the Son, that we are Sons; it aſſures us of our election, vocation, and ſalvation; and if it aſſure us of greater matters, then much more of the grant of our prayers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. But now knowledge is a further work, knowledge ſprings either from ſenſe or experience? Now then this unction of the Spirit which gives us experience, not only gives us confidence, but knowledge, that our prayers are heard, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. This Spirit of God in our hearts, gives us both ſenſible and experimentall knowledge of Gods favour, and breeds certain knowledge of the hearing and having our petitions granted; <hi>hearing,</hi> that is, of Gods accepting them, <hi>Verba ſenſus cum affectu, &amp; effectu ſunt intelligenda;</hi> and <hi>having,</hi> that is, of the performing and fulfilling of our deſires, chiefly of the ends and aims of our prayers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Serves to take off our hearts from confidence in any worldly thing, and incourages them to believe on the name of Jeſus Chriſt; why, becauſe hence you ſhall not only be aſſured of ſalvation, (which yet is more then all the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, and p lgrimages, and devotions of our Fore-fathers could reach unto) but by believing on the Name of Chriſt, you ſhall have confidence that all your prayers are heard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For them that doe believe in Chriſt, here is a method, whereby they may be aſſured of the granting their petitions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Make ſure your adoption, for that breeds much aſſurance in prayer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Meditate much on Chriſt, that Chriſt is your Advocate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and atonement for your ſins.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Labour for a Spirit of faith, and hope, and fear, and obedience, and ſo you ſhall grow up to confidence and knowledge that your prayers are gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Many a Chriſtian falls ſhort of this confidence, becauſe he conſiders not who helps him to make his prayers, who makes interceſſion for him, or elſe he is wanting in ſome of thoſe graces, and ſo his prayers are full of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Of conſolation to all that believe on Chriſt; why, <hi>This is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that whatſoever we ask according to Gods will, he heareth us.</hi> How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable then is the condition of a beleever? Be his eſtate never ſo miſerable, his wants never ſo great, if he can but pray well, he may goe on comfortably.</p>

But we muſt ſo look at the mote in their eye, as to ſee a beam in our own; we ſhould ſee as great ſins in our ſelves, or greater, if God did not reſtrain us, for we all have the ſame root of evill, and ſhould break out into as bad diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers as any, if God did not hold us back.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We muſt not obſerve them with a curious and cenſorious eye, for that is an imbred curioſity in us, that we love to be prying into other mens ſins, not to heal them, but to cenſure them. This St. <hi>James</hi> reproves, ch. 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>Be not many M ſters:</hi> that is be not of a Maſter-like ſpirit, be not buſie in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans matters, and cenſorious of them.</p>

                        <pb n="423" facs="tcp:65998:214"/>3 Look not at them with an envious, malicious eye. This <hi>Jeremiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of, ch. 20.10. <hi>All my familiars watched for my haltings.</hi> That's an envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eye, when a man watches for an advantage to undermine his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. There is a wanton eye:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When a man is not humbled at the ſight of his Brothers ſins, but puft up by it, like the proud Phariſee, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.9, 10. he built his comfort on the falls of others. This the Apoſtle reprehends in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.2. That there was fornication among them, and yet they were not humbled but puft up, they magnified themſelves that they were honeſter men.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A man ſees his Brothers ſin with a wanton eye, when he thereby grows to imitate him; if ſuch a man venture into ſuch a courſe, I hope I need not ſtick at it. This God gtievouſly complains of in the Church of <hi>Judah,</hi> that though ſhe ſaw what her treacherous Siſter <hi>Iſrael</hi> had done, and that God had therefore caſt her off, yet ſhe feared not, but went and played the Harlot alſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.7, 8. Now all thoſe heads of ſeeing our Brothers ſins ought to be far from us.</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Hence learn not to neglect the falls of our Brethren, as if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not to us, and we would neither meddle nor make with them. This was <hi>Cains</hi> ſpirit, <hi>Am I my Brothers keeper?</hi> Gen. 4.9. We ſhould look at every mans ſin as belonging unto us, and ſtrive to heal them.</p>
                     <p>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. To teach us to have a due regard to the falls of our Brethren, not to ſee them, and take no notice of them, but God requires we ſhould obſerve them, and help them, and make uſe of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What uſe ſhould we make of our Brethrens falls?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let their falls affect us with a holy fear and jealouſie of our own hearts; in that we have a deceitfull heart, ſubject to the like. This uſe <hi>Paul</hi> would have the Church of the <hi>Romanes</hi> to make of the fall of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 11.20.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Look at them with ſuch an eye as may move thee to pity thy Brother; if he be gone aſtray, bring him back; if he lye under the burthen of ſin, help him up, and if thou canſt not have opportunity to ſpeake to him, yet pray heartily for him, that is the frame of heart of every loving Chriſtian, to be compaſſionate of his Brothers miſery.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>Doth not the Holy Ghoſt ſay, love covereth a multitude of ſins?</hi> 1 Pet. 4. v. 8.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, it covers them, but how?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. With a mantle of wiſdome, not ſo cover them as to skinne over their wounds, but ſo cover them as that they may be covered before God and men, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.19, 20. This is a right covering, when a man takes ſuch a courſe as that his Brothers ſins may be covered from Gods eyes, and from the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſinner, that it may not be overwhelmed with them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. God would have us cover them not with a mantle of flattery, but with a healing plaiſter that may cure them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We muſt cover theſe ſins with a mantle of faithfulneſſe, that is, not to blaze them abroad to their defaming; but as if our Brothers beaſt lay under his burden, and we were notable to help him up alone, we get the help of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; this is faithfulneſſe, no further to reveale their infirmities, then to ſuch as may help them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.13.

                     <p>Firſt, Such a knowledge of the truth is required, as comes from the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the holy Ghoſt, when he is clearly let to ſee the truth of Gods Word, and the goodneſſe of his grace, if after this they ſin wilfully, there is no more hope of mercy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is malice in this ſin, that is included when its called <hi>the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 12.31, 32. which partly expreſſeth the object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which they ſin, which is the Spirit of grace, and the manner, it is done with ſpight and malice againſt the know truth.

From the nature of this ſin: Its not a ſin of ignorance, for want of knowledge, not a ſin of infirmity, nor is it onely a ſin of preſumption, for that may proceed from boldneſſe, rather then malice; but a ſin of malice far worſe than any of thoſe. <hi>He that despiſed Moſes Law dyed without mercy under two or three witneſſes;</hi> that is, that ſinned preſumptuouſly, and out of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for ſins of ignorance and infirmity, there were ſacrifices ordained in the Law; but if a man ſinned wilfully, he dyed without mercy, though his ſin were never ſo ſmall, as gathering of ſticks; now therefore, if there was no pardon for ſuch a ſin of preſumption, <hi>How much ſorer puniſhment is he worthy of, that tramples under foot the blood of the covenant, and doth despight to Spirit of grace?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 From the glory of Gods grace. It's the glory of grace that it extends to the pardoning and healing of all ſins beſides; no ſin of ihnorance or infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but grace can heal, the moſt preſumptuous it can humble, but if a man man maliciouſly deſpiſe the Spirit of grace, God that is moſt jealous of the glory of his grace, will never have it abuſed by them.</p>

The School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay it is one of thoſe ſiv ſins, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> reckons them up, either deſpair, or preſumption, or oppoſing the known truth, or envying the graces of others, or obſtinate purpoſe in ſin, or finall impenitency; but many of thoſe may be found in thoſe whom God afterwards receives to mercy. There hath been found deſpair even in Gods owne ſervants, Pſal. 31, 22. And as for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, <hi>Nathan</hi> chargeth <hi>David</hi> that had <hi>deſpiſed the commandement of the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:65998:216"/>
Lord.</hi> And that was a ſin of preſumption, <hi>Num:</hi> 16.30, 31. for oppugning the known truth. <hi>Herod</hi> put <hi>John</hi> in priſon, and to death; <hi>Darius</hi> caſt <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Lyons den, both againſt their conſcience, and yet neither of them ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt, becauſe they were both ſorry for it. <hi>Afa</hi> put the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in priſon. For envying the graces of others, it was found in <hi>Joſhua, Num.</hi> 11.28.29. For obſtinate purpoſe in ſin, its found in every one that ſins pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1, to 4. For finall impenitency, that it is not the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, becauſe St. <hi>John</hi> then would not have given order not to pray for them, for finall impenitency cannot be diſcerned till death, and ſo St. <hi>Johns</hi> direction had been but frivolous.</p>
                     <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> taught this ſin to be envy, and finall impenitency. <hi>Origen,</hi> any ſin after Baptiſme: The <hi>Novatians</hi> took up the ſame tenent; but that it was an error, is evident, for <hi>Peter</hi> ſinned after Baptiſme, and ſo are all the ſins of Gods children; if theſe were ſins againſt the holy Ghoſt, who ſhould be ſaved?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Of refutation of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Suarez,</hi> that ſay, Therefore this ſin is ſaid to be unto death, not that it is never pardoned, but not without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Whereas its ſaid to be impoſſible, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. They anſwer, <list>

                     </p>
                     <p>But were it a ſin that might be pardoned, though with never ſo much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, yet we ought to pray for it, and ſo much the more earneſtly; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing St <hi>John</hi> diſſwades us from the uſuall remedy againſt ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> prayer, therefore certainly its a ſin unto death, that cannot be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. A third errour hence refuted, is of thoſe that conceive this ſin is very rarely found, and more hardly to be diſcerned, but why doth St <hi>John</hi> write to common Chriſtians not to pray for them? a ſigne they may be found and diſcerned.</p>

Is not this ſin found too often in the Church? Many indeed of our Saviours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuters did it out of ignorance, and our Saviours prayer was effectuall for them, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they doe:</hi> But there were of them that knew him to be the heir, and ſaid, <hi>Come let us kill him,</hi> Mat. 21.38.

                     <p n="1">1. Of ſuch who having found much inlargement, after fall into deadneſſe, and ſlack-heartedneſſe, and all is dampt, and therefore they fear they have ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is the caſe of ſuch as have ſinned againſt their conſciences.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt ſort, its true, a man may ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, by vexing, and deſpiſing, and damping the Spirit, but yet this is not the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, unleſſe it be done with ſpight and ſcorn againſt Gods Spirit.</p>
                     <p>For the ſecond ſort, ſuch indeed as have ſinned againſt their conſciences, they have wronged their own ſouls, and brought much miſchiefe upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but yet a man may ſin againſt his conſcience, and not ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt; for it may either be done out of infirmity, or boldneſſe, as <hi>Peters</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> ſins were, they ſinned not out of ſpight and malice; if therefore thou fear thou haſt committed this ſin, this fear argues thou haſt not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, becauſe thou art afraid and ſorry for it.</p>
                     <p>Again, ſome anſwer thus, and ſay its not a ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt unleſſe it be joyned with an univerſall apoſtaſie from the whole Goſpel of Chriſt. Indeed that was a good mark in the primitive Church, when the Church cenſures were ſo hot, that ſuch were caſt out, and ſo being caſt out, turned open Pagans and enemies to Chriſt, being admitted into the Common-wealth; but now this is not ſo ſure a mark in our times, wherein ſuch a man ſhould not onely be excluded from the Church, but from the Common-wealth too; and therefore now they keep themſelves from open blaſpheming Chriſt, and ſo would thoſe former Apoſtates, had they lived in our dayes, and others would doe as they did, fly out as openly, had they lived in their dayes; and therefore judge not ſo much by that, as how thy heart ſtands affected to Chriſt. This is certain, <hi>they that are born of God ſin not</hi> this ſin, for they that ſin this ſin cannot avoid everlaſting death, whereas they that are born of God ſhall live for ever.</p>

<pb n="429" facs="tcp:65998:217"/>
made ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience, and withſtood <hi>Paul,</hi> and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> prays againſt him. Some think he did it as diſcerning by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary revelation that he was in a ſtate of reprobation, but that is not likely, he leaving his prayer as exemplary to all after comers. Gal. 5.12. <hi>I would that even thoſe were cut off that trouble you,</hi> that ſubvert or unddermine you, thoſe he wiſht they were utterly cut off from Church and Common-wealth. Thoſe falſe Apoſtles they would have overthrown the Goſpel of Chriſt, and brought in another Goſpel; and becauſe thoſe falſe Apoſtles were all alike, the Apoſtle diſcerned them to be in a ſtate of damnation, as being enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. At the firſt they preached the Goſpel, but afterwards turning aſide to earthly things, they began to magnifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and vilifie the Apoſtles, and ſo hindered the preaching of the Goſpel, and therefore he looks at them as deſerving to be cut off, he looks at them as dogs, Phil. 3.2. 1 Cor. 16.22. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be anathema maranatha;</hi> that is the greateſt curſe that can befall a man.</p>
                     <p>There was a threefold Excommunication in the primitive Church.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 A mere reſtraint from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, of ſuch as were ignorant, till they were better inſtructed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 There was <hi>Excommunicatio major,</hi> when they cut them off from all fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the Church, from the Word and Sacraments, and Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and from eating with them. This ought to be inflicted upon notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſcandalous ſinners.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Let him be <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> was a greater curſe then any of thoſe; for in the former Excommunication, though they excluded them from their fellowſhip, yet they ought not to count them as enemies, but might admoniſh them, and bring them on to repentance, that they might recover themſelves, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.14, 15. There was hope of ſuch, for they did therefore excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them that they might be ſaved, 1 Cor. 5.5. And when it was rightly diſpenſed, it was a notable means to humble them, when they conſidered, that if the Church ſaw cauſe to baniſh them from their ſociety, God might ſee much more cauſe to baniſh them from heaven. But yet there was a greater Excommunication, <hi>Let him be Anathema Maranatha;</hi> that is, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed untill the coming of the Lord; ſurely then their ſin is a ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt.</p>

<pb n="430" facs="tcp:65998:218"/>
Chriſt, and afterwards hate him, what doth he but ſhew that Chriſt was a notorious malefactor, and ſuffered not for other mens ſins, but his own? Therefore there is no hope Chriſt ſhould lend his Name to be a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>

But if men be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt enemies to Chriſt, then we doe not ſhew our ſelves to be Gods friends, if we ſhew friendſhip to them, or pray for them, and therefore our prayers will doe them no good, and our ſelves harm.</p>

If we be Children to Parents, or Wives to Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, or Subjects to Kings, and they ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, yet they may do civill ſervice and offices towards them, as thoſe that lived under <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate; he committed this ſin, therefore the Chriſtians prayed againſt him; but he had many Chriſtians in his Army that doubted whether they might ſerve him, or acknowledge him as their Emperor, or depoſe him; it was concluded they might ſerve him, but yet they prayed that God would take a courſe againſt him, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>his day ſhall come on,</hi> or <hi>he ſhall deſcend into the battle and periſh;</hi> which ſhews, that if a Prince ſhall ſin this ſin, his Subjects ought not to depoſe him, but to doe him offices of ſervice. The like may be ſaid of Children to Parents, and Wives to Husbands, if there be any tye of nature, a may doe them civill offices; which confutes that deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate doctrine of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, that whoſoever denyes the Pope to be the Supreme head of the Church, he is to be excommmunicated, and then no man is bound in allegiance to him, but that whoſoever ſhall ſlay ſuch an hereticall Prince, ſhall merit ſalvation.</p>
